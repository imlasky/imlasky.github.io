* Why is it so difficult to decide on what to work on?
* I want to make money, but I also want to build something I like
* I have to keep reminding myself that I need to build something that solves a problem for myself

I've been working on some ideas and found that originality is a rather tough thing to nail down.

Granted, the whole point of this blog is for me to document my temp projects, but even as a way to keep me accountable for them, I find myself almost making _more_ half-finished projects.

For instance, there are a few in my pipeline that I think are good ideas.
* An app that takes any recipe and puts it into the shopping cart of your choice
* A search engine that is strictly for reviews
* A drag-and-drop platform for data analysis
* An idea to simplify returns (like a reverse last-mile logistics sort of thing)

All of them have great intentions
