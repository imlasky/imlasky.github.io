I recently had a discussion about work and life. One of us was arguing that work and life is a balance. The other thought that it was not a zero-sum game, but rather the goal is for both to be fulfilling. 

And it got me thinking, is there a way to combine these two schools of thought? Can work and life both be a balance *and* be a non-zero-sum game?

Let's imagine that I'm able to work exactly 8 hours per day, live life 8 hours per day, and sleep 8 hours per day. Just based on time alone, this appears "balanced". It is, by the traditional definition, a "good work/life balance". 

In equation form, the day looks like this: 

<center>t_work + t_life + t_sleep = 24</center>
where t_work = t_life = t_sleep = 8.

But it is rarely a reflection of how the day ***feels***. What if we change the equation a bit, get a bit relativistic, and add in some "time dilation" constants (disclaimer: not actually relativity, but just roll with it, eh?). These constants will provide a better representation of how time feels, even if the raw hours themselves might be equal. 

Here's the new equation:
<center>c_work * t_work + c_life * t_life + c_sleep * t_sleep = 24</center>
where c_i >= 0.

Let's take a hypothetical day and see what happens. This day was a rough one. There were multiple deadlines that were due, presentations throughout the day, maybe a code review. All of this whiplash makes it seem as though the day just won't end. The c_work in this case is large, let's say 1.5. So, if I actually worked for 8 hours, it felt like 12. 

So, 12 out of the 24 hours are already gone.
