title: What happens when everyone starts selling shovels?

Let's start with a meme, shall we?

This line has almost always come up from my recent conversations around ✨_AI_✨ and I'm not sure how to feel about the advice anymore.

It has become so ubiquitous that it seems being the shovel maker has become just as popular as mining the ore itself. 

Let's take for instance the latest YC batch of AI companies. A good statistics writeup about the companies is[here](https://www.ignorance.ai/p/5-lessons-from-139-yc-ai-startups)and essentially shows that of the 139 YC startups that are related to AI/ML, AI ops and dev tools are the top two categories.

What does this mean for the ecosystem of builders that aren't making shovels? 

Well, for one it means that they have quite a bit of choice for which to use, if it is needed at all. 

Second, it starts to demonstrate that niche-ing down on an application of an AI system could actually prove to be more successful as quite a lot of people are vying to be the shovel maker. 

What this analogy also seems to miss are the ecosystems that are outside of digging for gold: like the jewelers that turn the gold into wedding rings, the lumberjacks that cut down trees for your shovel's handle, and the excavation teams digging for iron for your shovel's head.

All these people are not part of the digging, but are part of the ecosystem of the "gold rush".
