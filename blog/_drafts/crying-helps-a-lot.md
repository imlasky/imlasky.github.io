Perhaps this post might be too personal, but I felt the need to put it down. 

I cried a few nights ago.

I cried because I've realized that most day-to-day tasks are just too much for me to handle.

Clothes stack up.

The dishes remain dirty.

Returns are still sitting on my doorstep, way past due. 

It all just seems impenetrable.
