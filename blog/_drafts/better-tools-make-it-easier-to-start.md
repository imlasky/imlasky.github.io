"Right tool for the right job"

Somehow I've never fully internalized that quote. I think it has to do with needing to know what the right tool is in the first place. If you never hammered a nail into wood, how would you know to use a hammer except through experience?



* The right tools, not necessarily the best tools, make it easier to get started
* Starting from scratch is usually worse
* Accepting the ebb and flow of interest is fucking tough
