This morning I decided I wanted to build a little game. We've been playing all the NYT games lately, and wanted a new challenge. I thought of an idea and part of it requires generating random words (or ruin it for myself everyday and I generate them). 

I thought it'd be quite simple:
1. Generate random list of chars
2. Check how many combinations are actually English words
3. Check if they are relatively popular
3. Bada bing, bada boom, I have a randomly generated list of words

Except it didn't really work that way, as most things do. 

Here's a list of _valid_ English words generated by the characters "gatroolds":

`[
  'gaol',  'tool', 'trod',
  'good',  'rood', 'gold',
  'told',  'gats', 'goos',
  'roos',  'gals', 'tools',
  'ards',  'gods', 'rods',
  'goods', 'olds', 'golds'
]`

Okay, so most of the list is good (see what I did there?) - but there are some...strange ones that who in their right mind would ever guess? Like ards? Or gaol?

There's random words, and there's _random_ words. The kind of random that I am looking for is random, but recognizable, I suppose. Should be able to give you a bit of a challenge, but nothing that is so far outside your vocab that you just will never win. Never winning is no fun. 

So, what am I to do?
