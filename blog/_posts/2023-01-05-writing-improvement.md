Today is the 17th day in a row that I have written something and placed it out into the world, regardless if someone is reading it. 

And I have to say, that I feel like my voice is starting to really come through in my writing; I am becoming bolder, making the words flow a bit nicer, and developing a tone of my own. 

As I have been writing more, I've noticed a few new traits I exhibit:
* I like to write things in threes. There's a certain completeness of threes, a rhythm, a "hey those two previous things were nice, but here's an excellent number 3." I dunno, just going to go with it - it seems natural.
* Hyphens are my way, and I suppose a lot of people's way, of just getting to the point of the sentence. No more long winded essays - I just get to the point. Just like that. They're snappy and immediate.
