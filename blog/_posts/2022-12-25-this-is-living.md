I just spent the last two nights in a[Getaway](https://getaway.house/). The ethos of the entire experience is to disconnect, embrace nature, yourself, and find a new balance. 

I'll be making a lengthier version tomorrow since I want to keep this short tonight. 

But I feel like I've experienced something primal. Something that braced me by my shoulders, shook me, and said "Hey, wake up. This is living." 

I now want to figure out how to feel that everyday.
