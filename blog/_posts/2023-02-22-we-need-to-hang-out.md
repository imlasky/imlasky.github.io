title: We Need to Hang Out
---

I have been re-listening to Billy Baker's book "We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends" after my first listen back in 2020 during the heigh of the pandemic. 

And it still resonates with me more than ever. 

I have a few acquaintances that I've made that could be good friends to hang out with, but it's that initial outreach, that vulnerability to say "hey, I like you, let's hang out" that just takes so much will power to say.

Thankfully one of them reached out and we did something fun with our significant others tonight. It was a ton of fun, don't get me wrong, but there is something about being with just guys that just hits different. 

I am going to make a more concerted effort towards making, and retaining, friends, I think. 

Because I miss just hanging out and being stupid sometimes.
