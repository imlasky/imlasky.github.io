Yesterday I added some analytics to this blog, since I was already adding some to my project,[Indie Comp Jobs]({% post_url /projects/2023-01-02-indie-comp-jobs%}). 

But then I realized something: I really don't care about analytics for my blog. I mean, what do I really get out of it? Seeing how many people are reading? Seeing what they like? I'm not writing for them - I'm writing for me. 

I'll add an email in case there is someone out there that actually does ready these posts and wants to chat, but other than that, I swiftly deleted the analytics because fuck metrics.
