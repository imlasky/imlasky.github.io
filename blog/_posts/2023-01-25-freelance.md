Today I had the thought that maybe freelancing might be an interesting path forward. I can:

* Take only the work I want
* Set my own rate
* Set my own hours
* Work from anywhere

Of course, to do these things, I need to develop a portfolio. I'm thinking I can do something with data science, maybe some web dev, or some due diligence.

But I feel like it is getting closer to the ideal.

The only hang up is actually how much I can make with this. Maybe starting out it is a bit low, but will it increase?

I still want to build something of my own, so maybe this is the path towards doing that.
