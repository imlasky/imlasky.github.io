***Hangry*** (adj.): bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger.

I'm dealing with a dilemma. I am trying intermittent fasting to lose weight. But on the flip side, I become extremely hangry. Currently trying to figure out how to deal with it. Maybe I'll start drinking coffee again to curb my appetite? That seems like a step in the wrong direction though.
