title: Next steps for your application to tech.ai
---

Hi there, {applicant}!

We're so happy that you expressed your interest in joining **tech.ai** &mdash; the leading AI company transforming the {industry} industry (and is _definitely not_ just an API call to OpenAI)! 

We have received your application and are happy to move you on to the first round which is a take-home assignment which shouldn't take you more than 2-3 weeks. We hope you have as much fun completing it as we have had designing it! It's designed to test a variety of skills such as:

* perseverance
* obedience
* how much shit you can take
* your desperation for a job
* coding!

We've attached the prompt for the first round to this email, it's a quick 22 page read to give you sufficient background into the problem. (Hint: don't forget the quirk on page 17!). 

The expected output is a report document that is expected to contain UML diagrams, Figma wireframes, burndown charts of your progress, a picture of a pony, and a detailed document of your approach and reasoning for each line of code. Additionally, we expect the project to be completed in both python 2.7 and 3.11 - we advise creating a docker image of your project so we can run it on our end. 

To give you a peek at the rest of the process - we've optimized it for speed since we are **urgently hiring**. So, if you are deemed worthy enough to pass the first stage, the rest of the interview process will look like the following (subject to change):

1. Recruiter phone screen to go over your resume [30 min]
2. Live coding and behavioral interview [60 min]
3. Chat with Product Manager [45 min]
4. Second take-home assignment [2-3 weeks]
5. Review of first and second take-home assignments [10 min]
6. Behavioral interview with principal engineer [30 mins]
7. Third take-home assignment [2-3 weeks]
8. Presentation of third take-home to hiring panel [3 hours]
9. Meet and greet with other engineers [60 min]
10. 2 month paid working trial [2 months]
11. Chat with CPO [60 mins]
12. Wait 2 weeks while we see if there is someone else [2 weeks]
13. Offer!

We've carefully crafted all 13 steps above to help make the process easy and ensure that there is a good fit &mdash; the hiring process goes both ways, after all!

Due to the high volume of applicants, we can't guarantee that we'll get back to you with detailed feedback of your take-home assignment, but we'll make sure to maybe skim some of the first page. 

Thanks again for your interest in tech.ai! We can't wait to have you on board. 

Sincerely,

{recruiter}
