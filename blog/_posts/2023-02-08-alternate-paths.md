I've been working on a[new project]({% post_url /projects/2023-02-01-journata%}), and was basically just building something that I really had no idea what should be in it. 

So, instead, I thought I'd take a diversion and actually try to write an article using some of the tools I'd want to make, so that I can find the rough patches and see what I want to build. 

Taking the alternate path to get to the same destination.
