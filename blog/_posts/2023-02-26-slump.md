How do I get out of a slump? I exercise a few times a weak, my eating is kind of bleh, but every time I try I end up back at the same point. 

Maybe there are different avenues to the same destination for getting out of the slump. 

I was reminded of the 4000 week idea recently, and I feel like I just burned one or two that will never be coming back. How can I treasure the remaining weeks?
