Today I went to a hotpot place in Chinatown. Nevermind the blaring drums I heard, I was in the mood for some hotpot and went.

When I went there, the lunar new year festival was ongoing, with its brilliant red and yellow dragons, crackling fireworks, and crowds of onlookers. 

I made my way inside the restaurant, only to be followed moments after by what was outside - the drums and dragons.

They danced around the restaurant, tossing lettuce out of their mouths, and quite frankly was one of the more unique experiences I have had in a while. 

The hotpot was good too. 

I got the tonkotsu broth.
