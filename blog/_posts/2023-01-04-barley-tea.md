Barley tea has been a relatively new discovery for myself. It is exactly what it sounds like: barley boiled in hot water. 

But I find myself basically chugging it now. 

That slight bit of toasty, warm-by-the-fire, safe-in-my-little-cottage flavor seems to keep calling me back - and it isn't even that strong of a flavor. It just whispers to me and draws me in for another sip. 

I want to make more things like barley tea; things that keep calling me back with their simplicity and always provide just the right amount of delight.
