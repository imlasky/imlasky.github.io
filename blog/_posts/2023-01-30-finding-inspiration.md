Inspiration is probably the most elusive of experiences. I eagerly hope that it hits me, become defeated when it doesn't, then when I am not looking for it, it comes to me. 

It's like the saying "a watched pot never boils".

Somehow, inspiration is like repelling magnets. I turn to the idea, push towards it, but there is this invisible force pushing back, resisting me. 

Only once I turn away, have the opposite regard towards inspiration, does it finally come to me. 

Is it as simple as just being aloof more often?

Or creating more activities in my life where I don't have to think about problems / making something?

Maybe that's the same reason that I fall asleep and wake up with answers, as others do as well. It gives me time to turn my magnet around and focus on something else.
