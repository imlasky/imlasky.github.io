I had my violin lesson today - it was okay. It was one of those lessons where we basically spend the entire time one only a couple bars because...well, I didn't practice that much and she knows it. 

So, we drill it, trying to figure it out together. But at the end of the day, I just really need to go home and practice. Because that one hour isn't going to do anything if the rest of the week I just am blah.
