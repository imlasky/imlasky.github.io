Went ice skating yesterday and today. I used to play ice hockey - I missed the feeling of effortlessly gliding around.

While skating, I also had a thought about design of things and how the best tools I've used feel like an extension of myself, like my skates: I don't feel like I am off the ice - I feel firmly planted on the ice. 

But when I am at my computer, it feels like I'm using a computer; or when I use my phone, it feels like I'm using my phone. 

Not sure what to make of it just yet.
