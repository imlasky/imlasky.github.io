title: You just have to listen
---

Lately, I've been in a bit of a mental rut that I want to build something, but find myself lost for what to build. I made a little toy project for fun ([snapress](https://snapress.com)), but finished it in a weekend and found myself longing again for something new. 

I went to sleep last night, and maybe it was a combination of being in this longing state as well as doing a fast that day, but it was the first time in my life that I had a dream give me advice.

There in my dream I was essentially shadowing a version of Steve Jobs, looking at what he was looking at when it came to phones: the clunky key presses on keyboards crammed into the plastic, the long loading times of pictures on what he calls a "baby internet", and applications that are sluggish without any real power. 

And I watched people struggling with these things with the current knowledge now of easier interfaces, more powerful cameras, and full-fledged applications and the solution feels obvious. 

It was then that this fictional Steve Jobs I've hallucinated in my dream says to me:

> They'll be telling you the solution the whole time
>
> You just have to listen

I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to listen instead of actively seek out new projects.
