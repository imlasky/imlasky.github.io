I used to make bread. A lot of bread. Baguettes, boules, croissants - you get it. 

For a holiday gift exchange at my previous work, I received a packet of sourdough starter and Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast. I know I am very late to the sourdough train, but I figured I will start baking again. Last time I remember doing it, it brought a tremendous joy to my life.
