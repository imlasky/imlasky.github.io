Sometimes I just get sidetracked and become super focused on a certain thing. 

Today, I basically programmed a new kind of cipher game that looks neat. Its visuals are similar to wordle, so I'm trying to change that, but it basically all works. 

I dunno, maybe I just like building little things like this?
