So, in my first project post, I complained a bit about all the different web development frameworks and that, frankly, I was struggling with how intimidating they seemed.[[1]]({% post_url /projects/2022-05-31-temp-project-website%})

However, yesterday I finally decided I am just going to learn it already.

Like jumping into cold water for the first time, it seems worse in my head than it actually is. Over time, I think the perceived difficulty built up to be more than it actually is. Sure, I'm not going to be an expert out of the gate, but I think I can get to a point that I can dabble sufficiently. 

I suppose I'll find out. 

Anyways, this is a very long-winded way to say that I am essentially starting from scratch with React and Javascript. How'd I pick React? I'm not sure. From what I've read, it is one of the most popular frameworks and I might as well start somewhere.
