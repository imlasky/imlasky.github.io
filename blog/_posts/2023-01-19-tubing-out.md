When I was growing up, I learned the phrase "tube out". It's kind of like zone out, but with the tube meaning TV instead. 

Sometimes it's good to just tube out - some days almost require it. 

Today was one of those days. 

It started a bit frustratingly, but I sort of needed to let my brain just stop for a bit. Traveling sometimes does this, but it's often overcome with excitement or enjoyment. 

This state is almost none of that. It's a gray area. A sort of mental purgatory (albeit one you can escape from). 

I think it is in this place that our brains process things, digest the day, our current selves, and offer up some advice for us to follow. 

Too much in this space and there's nothing to process. Too little time and it never gets a break.
