I've been doing intermittent fasting for a few days now and, expectedly, I become hungry and hyper-aware of the time near the end of the fasting window. 

This isn't the first time I have done intermittent fasting - in fact, it's actually close to how I naturally eat. I forget to eat some meals sometimes, so IF more or less systemizes what I do naturally. 

To counteract me being hyper-aware of the time, I have tried to figure out different ways to distract myself of the time, make my mind focus on something else. Today, I went for a walk. Plugged in to an audiobook, and walked it out. I found that my hunger sort of decreased as I was walking, almost to the point where I couldn't feel any hunger at all. 

When I came back, though, I was ravenous. I have since learned that I need foods that are quick to eat. I do not have tons of patience to cook while I am hungry like that. 

But I've been thinking of how I can translate this skill of distracting myself to steer away from a feeling into other domains. For instance, how I can I reorient myself when I am feeling frustrated? Or sad? Or lethargic? I have a feeling that walking might help with most, but maybe there are some other tools. I have traditionally turned to eating, but that really isn't the best way to always deal with these things and can create a spiral. 

Anyways, it was a good fast today. It's getting easier and I'm feeling better each day.
