Searching for a new job lately. But it's rather difficult filtering through jobs, and getting the _vibe_ from them, you know? I also, deep down, want to build something of my own. So, it can sometimes feel a bit meh when applying to jobs to help others built their thing.

Going to try to figure out a better way to rank these companies for myself. Maybe others might be able to use it too.
