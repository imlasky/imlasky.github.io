My violin was in the shop for a bit due to a split seam and for needing a bridge adjustment. I got it back today and, after practicing on the loaner instrument, reminded myself why I invested into getting a good instrument. 

It _wants_ to be played well. Its resonance guides my fingers to the right position as if there was a small indentation and going to either side of it pushes me back the right direction. 

I'm always amazed by the sheer simplicity of the instrument and how, from its simplicity, masterpieces and virtuosos have emerged.
