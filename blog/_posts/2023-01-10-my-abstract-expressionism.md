There's been this idea swirling in my head, where I can't quite see the full shapes just yet. The raw colors are there, but the subject, the meat of the thing still escapes me - like it is some piece of abstract expressionism. 

It's reaching out from my bones.

I feel it during my walks in the city.

With every time I look at my phone.

Every time I wish to both connect and disconnect.

Every time I wish to do something more with my hands, be more human, make use of the fact that I am a product of evolution and be reminded of the fact that the technology we have is not fully evolved for _me_. 

Why can't using technology be as calming as breathing in the fresh air near a still lake?

Why can't using technology be as comforting as eating the first warm bowl of soup when you have a cold?

Why can't using technology be as uplifting like getting hit by the first rays of sun in Spring?

Why has it become that I need to _escape_ from technology? Did we ever need to escape from hammers, from cars, from refrigerators? 

I'm frustrated. 

But I feel like the painting is becoming clearer every day with each new brushstroke.
