    <h1>Tossing Out The Cupcakes</h1>
<p>02 Nov 2023</p>

<div class="highlight-cool">
    <button id="show-highlights">Show highlights</button>
    <p>Last Friday we hosted a Halloween party. As expected, all of our friends brought food, in addition to the food that we bought for the party: cupcakes, Oreos, chips, pretzels, candy, candy corn, and a ton of booze.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that everyone was mostly craving savory things (chips, pretzels, etc.) and not so much sweet things (cupcakes, candy). So, we were left with all of that the next day.</p>

<p>I found myself going to the kitchen multiple times to nibble on a double-stuff Oreo or two. A cupcake at noon and after dinner.</p>

<p>And then I caught myself – what am I doing? Why am I eating this?</p>

<p>I didn’t feel any joy from eating these things. I have been struggling with weight and I am just fighting against myself here.</p>

<p>So, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a trash bag, and one after another began tossing out the cupcakes and cookies that were left. I didn’t want them in my sight or in the house because I just couldn’t resist them.</p>

<p>I felt good about getting it out of the house and would rather toss it out than put it in my body anymore.</p>

<p>It was a good step forward for me and felt like a stake in the ground that I have had enough of how I’m eating.</p>
