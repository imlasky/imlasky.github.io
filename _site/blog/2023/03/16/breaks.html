    <h1>Breaks</h1>
<p>16 Mar 2023</p>

<p>One of my friends told me about a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take breaks, not stops</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took a break from writing everyday. I found I became very in my head, tossing things around that, while yes they were good to get down, made me ruminate too much and put me into a bit of a hole.</p>

<p>I’m back now and feeling refreshed.</p>

<p>I have a trip to Italy in less than two weeks, where I hope to make my sense of self even more whole.</p>

<p>A new idea has been stuck in my brain, one about learning. It is similar to the flashcard project idea I had, but a little more expansive. I’ll create a post of that separately.</p>

<hr />

<p>Other benefits that I have noticed about myself have been that I have not stepped on the scale once. It has brought a new kind of peace to myself. Where I don’t tie myself to a number and don’t let it define me. I have been going to the gym, feeling stronger each day, eating better, and embracing the difference day by day.</p>

<p>I have to remind myself that this is my year of simplicity. My year of embracing how simple things can prove the most enjoyable - how the simple things are the ones that end up making me happier all around.</p>
