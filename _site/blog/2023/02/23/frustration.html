    <p>I know I am impatient. And with this impatience comes additional stress and burden I carry upon myself to get things right and move faster, do more, improve, etc. It sometimes affects relationships, where that impatience is carried over into how I communicate.</p>

<p>It’s like some animalistic nature just surges forward, climbing out of my skin, and takes over, creating an out-of-body experience where I can actively hear myself say the things I’m saying, but not in the driver’s seat. I need to change that. Because when I am not in the driver’s seat, I also cannot listen properly.</p>
