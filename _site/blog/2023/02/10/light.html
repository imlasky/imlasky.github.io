    <h1>Light</h1>
<p>10 Feb 2023</p>

<p>Today, I saw ahead. Just a little bit. I felt a path that I had not felt in a while, something that says “that way looks pretty good, let’s take that route”.</p>

<p>I recognized a truth about myself: I like data science, but I don’t love it. What I do really enjoy, and finding myself consistently defaulting to, is the visuals. Data visualization.</p>

<p>And today, I found others. I found others that are the same way. I read a blog post by<a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/about/">Nadieh Bremer</a>detailing her journey towards what she does now - and it is damn near identical.</p>

<ol>
  <li>She studied astronomy (I studied aerospace engineering)</li>
  <li>Didn’t want to do the Ph.D, but did the master’s (same),</li>
  <li>Went to consulting at Deloitte as a data scientist (I did consulting and data science at a boutique consulting firm)</li>
  <li>Became disenchanted with data science</li>
</ol>

<p>But then she said in her post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then I went to a presentation by Mike Freeman. On his title slide it said Data Visualization Specialist. And it was as if I’d been hit by lighting. that’s a thing on its own?! You can specialize in data visualization?!”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now I am having that same epiphany. I don’t know where it will lead, if I will end up doing it forever, but it is a path, a light, something to give me a good place to place my next step.</p>
