    <h1>We Need to Hang Out</h1>
<p>22 Feb 2023</p>

<p>I have been re-listening to Billy Baker’s book “We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends” after my first listen back in 2020 during the height of the pandemic.</p>

<p>And it still resonates with me more than ever.</p>

<p>I have a few acquaintances that I’ve made that could be good friends to hang out with, but it’s that initial outreach, that vulnerability to say “hey, I like you, let’s hang out” that just takes so much will power to say.</p>

<p>Thankfully one of them reached out and we did something fun with our significant others tonight. It was a ton of fun, don’t get me wrong, but there is something about being with just guys that just hits different.</p>

<p>I am going to make a more concerted effort towards making, and retaining, friends, I think.</p>

<p>Because I miss just hanging out and being stupid sometimes.</p>
