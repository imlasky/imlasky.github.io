<p>I’ve become convinced that there will always be an elusive perfect library in the open source community. That is, for the purposes I’m trying to use something, all packages out there miss the mark <em>just</em> enough, that I need to go write it on my own. I know that sounds super privileged, and I fully support the OSS community - but just once, it’d be great to find a library that just <em>works</em> for me, ya know?</p>
