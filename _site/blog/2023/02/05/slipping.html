    <h1>Slipping</h1>
<p>05 Feb 2023</p>

<p>I had my violin lesson today - it was okay. It was one of those lessons where we basically spend the entire time one only a couple bars because…well, I didn’t practice that much and she knows it.</p>

<p>So, we drill it, trying to figure it out together. But at the end of the day, I just really need to go home and practice. Because that one hour isn’t going to do anything if the rest of the week I just am blah.</p>
