    <h1>Lagging</h1>
<p>04 Feb 2023</p>

<p>Been finding I have been a day behind on each of these posts, usually writing what I had wanted to write the day before. But somehow, I still find it on the level and not quite cheating, because I’m still writing.</p>

<p>However, I will dedicate more time to it than I have been.</p>
