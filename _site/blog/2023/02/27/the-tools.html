    <h1>The Tools</h1>
<p>27 Feb 2023</p>

<p>Decided to watch the movie Stutz, which is about Jonah Hill’s therapist, Phil Stutz. He’s a well-known therapist in Hollywood, but that was the first I’ve ever heard of him. And frankly, the ideas presented are going to help me change things.</p>

<p>Even from just watching, hearing the phrasing about the Shadow, and relating to Hill that my shadow is a younger, overweight self, it finally clicked to have compassion for that self. It is a part of me. My Shadow would feel bad for how I have thought of him. I feel bad for thinking of him the same way others may have thought of him, despite knowing him the best.</p>

<p>I also downloaded his two audio books, The Tools and Coming Alive, written with Barry Michels. I plan to take these tools into practice.</p>

<p>It’ll take a bit of adjustment to the language, which frankly sounds a little loopy. But hey, most ideas sound loopy before you try them. Especially the good ones.</p>
