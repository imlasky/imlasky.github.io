    <h1>Alternate Paths</h1>
<p>08 Feb 2023</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a<a href="/projects/2023/02/01/journata.html">new project</a>, and was basically just building something that I really had no idea what should be in it.</p>

<p>So, instead, I thought I’d take a diversion and actually try to write an article using some of the tools I’d want to make, so that I can find the rough patches and see what I want to build.</p>

<p>Taking the alternate path to get to the same destination.</p>
