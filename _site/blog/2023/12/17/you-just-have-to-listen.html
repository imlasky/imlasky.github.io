    <p>Lately, I’ve been in a bit of a mental rut that I want to build something, but find myself lost for what to build. I made a little toy project for fun (<a href="https://snapress.com">snapress</a>), but finished it in a weekend and found myself longing again for something new.</p>

<p>I went to sleep last night, and maybe it was a combination of being in this longing state as well as doing a fast that day, but it was the first time in my life that I had a dream give me advice.</p>

<p>There in my dream I was essentially shadowing a version of Steve Jobs, looking at what he was looking at when it came to phones: the clunky key presses on keyboards crammed into the plastic, the long loading times of pictures on what he calls a “baby internet”, and applications that are sluggish without any real power.</p>

<p>And I watched people struggling with these things with the current knowledge now of easier interfaces, more powerful cameras, and full-fledged applications and the solution feels obvious.</p>

<p>It was then that this fictional Steve Jobs I’ve hallucinated in my dream says to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They’ll be telling you the solution the whole time</p>

  <p>You just have to listen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to listen instead of actively seek out new projects.</p>
