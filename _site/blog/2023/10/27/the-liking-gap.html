    <h1>The Liking Gap</h1>
<p>27 Oct 2023</p>

<div class="highlight-cool">
    <button id="show-highlights">Show Highlights</button>
    <p>I’ve been reading a book lately called Platonic (shout out to the Boston Public Library’s discover section).</p>

<p>There is this concept in it that I found rather insightful: the “liking gap”.</p>

<p>The “liking gap” is the concept that how much we perceive someone likes us is usually an underestimate of how much they actually do.</p>

<p>This can be translated into a number of scenarios.</p>

<p>For me, I’ve used this when chatting to people at events – I assume they’d like to chat and are open to connection.</p>

<p>I approach them, say hello and introduce myself, and ask a question.</p>

<p>Most recently I was at a Bahamas concert and noticed a few people next to me.</p>

<p>They weren’t initiating, so I remembered what I read about the liking gap. So, I initiated and we connected over our love of the band and chatted about their new album – it was a great connection!</p>

<p>Another recent connection is a friend I’ve been emailing back and forth with after finding their blog. I was interested in their story, and felt I could maybe offer some advice for their situation. It’s been fun so far to encourage them to start a project and to also reflect on how much I’ve grown with my technical knowledge from my own projects.</p>

<p>The best part of all this is that it is <em>repeatable</em> and <em>practicable</em>. I can do it whenever, wherever, make new connections, meet new people, learn about them and their world and maybe, just maybe, foster a new friendship.</p>
