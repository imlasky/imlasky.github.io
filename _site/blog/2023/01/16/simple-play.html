    <h1>Simple Play</h1>
<p>16 Jan 2023</p>

<p>This morning was the first morning of winter that we had a proper snow. The snow was the perfect snow for snowballs and snowmen.</p>

<p>So, this morning, I went outside, and started rolling snow around. Slowly gathering it at first, but then more gradually until I had a ball that was probably hundreds of pounds. It was a proper workout near the end; essentially needing to do dead lifts to roll the damn thing.</p>

<p>But it was fun.</p>

<p>A pure kind of fun.</p>

<p>The kind of fun that I yearn for when I reminisce about my childhood.</p>

<p>It was simple: roll the ball of snow until I become tired. Maybe stack another on top to make it taller because taller snow is better snow and looks cool.</p>

<p>Why does anything need to be more complicated?</p>
