    <h1>Emotionally Tired</h1>
<p>27 Jan 2023</p>

<p>Sometimes there are days that are just <em>days</em>, you know? Conversations are a little more weary, speaking becomes more effortful, and you’d like to just stop it all, get under the covers, and let tomorrow come already.</p>

<p>That’s where I’m at now.</p>

<p>I want tomorrow to be here.</p>
