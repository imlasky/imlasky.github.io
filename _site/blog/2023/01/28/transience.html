    <h1>Transience</h1>
<p>28 Jan 2023</p>

<p>Boston has a certain kind of transience. The concentration of schools lends itself for people to go to school here, get hired locally, and then maybe after a few years leave.</p>

<p>Is it like this everywhere? Is life just transient like that or am I missing something?</p>
