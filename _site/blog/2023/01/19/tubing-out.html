    <h1>Tubing Out</h1>
<p>19 Jan 2023</p>

<p>When I was growing up, I learned the phrase “tube out”. It’s kind of like zone out, but with the tube meaning TV instead.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s good to just tube out - some days almost require it.</p>

<p>Today was one of those days.</p>

<p>It started a bit frustratingly, but I sort of needed to let my brain just stop for a bit. Traveling sometimes does this, but it’s often overcome with excitement or enjoyment.</p>

<p>This state is almost none of that. It’s a gray area. A sort of mental purgatory (albeit one you can escape from).</p>

<p>I think it is in this place that our brains process things, digest the day, our current selves, and offer up some advice for us to follow.</p>

<p>Too much in this space and there’s nothing to process. Too little time and it never gets a break.</p>
