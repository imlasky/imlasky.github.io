    <h1>Writing Improvement</h1>
<p>05 Jan 2023</p>

<p>Today is the 17th day in a row that I have written something and placed it out into the world, regardless if someone is reading it.</p>

<p>And I have to say, that I feel like my voice is starting to really come through in my writing; I am becoming bolder, making the words flow a bit nicer, and developing a tone of my own.</p>

<p>As I have been writing more, I’ve noticed a few new traits I exhibit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I like to write things in threes. There’s a certain completeness of threes, a rhythm, a “hey those two previous things were nice, but here’s an excellent number 3.” I dunno, just going to go with it - it seems natural.</li>
  <li>Hyphens are my way, and I suppose a lot of people’s way, of just getting to the point of the sentence. No more long winded essays - I just get to the point. Just like that. They’re snappy and immediate.</li>
  <li>Here’s a third bullet. See bullet 1.</li>
</ul>
