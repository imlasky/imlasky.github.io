    <h1>Bleeding</h1>
<p>22 Jan 2023</p>

<p>The other day I was peeling some squash and my peeler slipped. It took a good little chunk out of my left ring finger.</p>

<p>I ran to the bathroom to patch it up, but I paused. I watched the blood sort of pool up on my finger and then drip into the sink.</p>

<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>

<p>And while it did, I found myself in a trance - I couldn’t stop watching it.</p>

<p>There was something about seeing the fact that, yes, I can and do bleed that was humbling. It brought me down to mortality for a bit, reminding me of all of these systems inside of me, operating ceaselessly to keep me moving, waking up every morning, and fending off threats.</p>

<p>But there was something else that occurred: I found myself focusing on nothing else. No existential thoughts of what I will do with my life. No concerns about what I’ll do tomorrow, or the laundry I need to do, or that I should reach out to friends.</p>

<p>It was a singular moment for a small finger cut.</p>
