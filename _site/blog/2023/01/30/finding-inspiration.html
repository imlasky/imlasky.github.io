    <h1>Finding Inspiration</h1>
<p>30 Jan 2023</p>

<div class="highlight-cool">

    <p>Inspiration is probably the most elusive of experiences. I eagerly hope that it hits me, become defeated when it doesn’t, then when I am not looking for it, it comes to me.</p>

<p>It’s like the saying “a watched pot never boils”.</p>

<p>Somehow, inspiration is like repelling magnets. I turn to the idea, push towards it, but there is this invisible force pushing back, resisting me.</p>

<p>Only once I turn away, have the opposite regard towards inspiration, does it finally come to me.</p>

<p>Is it as simple as just being aloof more often?</p>

<p>Or creating more activities in my life where I don’t have to think about problems / making something?</p>

<p>Maybe that’s the same reason that I fall asleep and wake up with answers, as others do as well. It gives me time to turn my magnet around and focus on something else.</p>
