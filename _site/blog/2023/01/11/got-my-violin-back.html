    <h1>Got My Violin Back</h1>
<p>11 Jan 2023</p>

<p>My violin was in the shop for a bit due to a split seam and for needing a bridge adjustment. I got it back today and, after practicing on the loaner instrument, reminded myself why I invested into getting a good instrument.</p>

<p>It <em>wants</em> to be played well. Its resonance guides my fingers to the right position as if there was a small indentation and going to either side of it pushes me back the right direction.</p>

<p>I’m always amazed by the sheer simplicity of the instrument and how, from its simplicity, masterpieces and virtuosos have emerged.</p>
