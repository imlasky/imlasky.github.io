    <h1>Looking For Jobs</h1>
<p>20 Jan 2023</p>

<p>Searching for a new job lately. But it’s rather difficult filtering through jobs, and getting the <em>vibe</em> from them, you know? I also, deep down, want to build something of my own. So, it can sometimes feel a bit meh when applying to jobs to help others built their thing.</p>

<p>Going to try to figure out a better way to rank these companies for myself. Maybe others might be able to use it too.</p>
