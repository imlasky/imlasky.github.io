    <h1>My Abstract Expressionism</h1>
<p>10 Jan 2023</p>

<p>There’s been this idea swirling in my head, where I can’t quite see the full shapes just yet. The raw colors are there, but the subject, the meat of the thing still escapes me - like it is some piece of abstract expressionism.</p>

<p>It’s reaching out from my bones.</p>

<p>I feel it during my walks in the city.</p>

<p>With every time I look at my phone.</p>

<p>Every time I wish to both connect and disconnect.</p>

<p>Every time I wish to do something more with my hands, be more human, make use of the fact that I am a product of evolution and be reminded of the fact that the technology we have is not fully evolved for <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>Why can’t using technology be as calming as breathing in the fresh air near a still lake?</p>

<p>Why can’t using technology be as comforting as eating the first warm bowl of soup when you have a cold?</p>

<p>Why can’t using technology be as uplifting like getting hit by the first rays of sun in Spring?</p>

<p>Why has it become that I need to <em>escape</em> from technology? Did we ever need to escape from hammers, from cars, from refrigerators?</p>

<p>I’m frustrated.</p>

<p>But I feel like the painting is becoming clearer every day with each new brushstroke.</p>
