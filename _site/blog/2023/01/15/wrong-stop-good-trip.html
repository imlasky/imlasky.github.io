    <h1>Wrong Stop; Good Trip</h1>
<p>15 Jan 2023</p>

<p>In Boston, every weekend we have $10 all-you-can-ride tickets for the commuter trains. It’s a great, inexpensive way to get out of the city. Today’s activity was to take the train, head south a bit, and then go for a hike, maybe something with a bit of a view.</p>

<p>We got off the train to find ourselves in a sort of cookie-cutter town on the Boston outskirts. You know the kind - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1">5-over-1 apartments</a>, with the single grocery store, a few generic restaurants, a Michael’s, and a Yankee Candle.</p>

<p>Walking just the expanse of this single parking lot is close to half a mile - pure American bigness, eh? We wanted to grab a quick snack before heading off to hike.</p>

<p>But it turns out, we couldn’t cross the interstate to get to the park. We’d either have to take an Uber, or walk nearly 4 hours. So, we decided to just try a smaller park around - but there was construction.</p>

<p>So, there we were, getting whipped by the cold wind, in an industrial park, in a town I can confuse with hundreds of others, and we decided to just call it a day.</p>

<p>On the way back, we grabbed a pair of WoodWick candles from that single Yankee Candle ‘cause they were half-off (the bergamot and basil is quite delightful).</p>

<p>Anyways, it was a good trip anyways because it was memorable.</p>
