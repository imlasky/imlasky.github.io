    <h1>Ikigai</h1>
<p>01 Sep 2023</p>

<p>Ikigai is a Japanese concept that roughly translates to “a reason for being”. You might have seen it floating around the internet as a Venn diagram with 4 circles: what you love, what you’re good at, what you can be paid for, and what the world needs.</p>

<p>It’s a concept I’ve been wrestling with – is this something that is sought out actively or one that occurs naturally? My answer has been slowly shaping towards 30% of the first and 70% of the second.</p>

<p>As a bit of a tangent, there’s a famous psychiatrist Dr. Phil Stutz who popularized the idea of one’s “life force”, pictured as a pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid you have body, in the middle you have relationships, and at the top you have self.</p>

<p>When lost or in search of meaning, focusing on one or more of these levels is a way to keep movement in your life.</p>

<p>Focus on your body: start eating better, run, sleep, go outside and feel the sun warm your face – anything to get the body moving and feeling good.</p>

<p>Enrich and strengthen your relationships with others: seek out those who you want to feel connected to, show up for each other.</p>

<p>And finally, work on yourself: improve your skills, learn something new, tangential, unrelated to anything else. Focus on broadening values and experiences.</p>

<p>I’ve really been in a rut lately and have had to remind myself that things have always happened for me when I focused on my “life force” first and that I need to trust in myself. Because it is only through doing that, that I feel I can find what my own ikigai is.</p>
