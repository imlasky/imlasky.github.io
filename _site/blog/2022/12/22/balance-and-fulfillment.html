    <h1>Balance And Fulfillment</h1>
<p>22 Dec 2022</p>

<p>I recently had a discussion about work and life. One of us was arguing that work and life is a balance. The other thought that it was not a zero-sum game, but rather the goal is for both to be fulfilling.</p>

<p>And it got me thinking, is there a way to combine these two schools of thought? Can work and life both be a balance <em>and</em> be a non-zero-sum game?</p>

<p>Let’s imagine that I’m able to work exactly 8 hours per day, live life 8 hours per day, and sleep 8 hours per day. Just based on time alone, this appears “balanced”. It is, by the traditional definition, a “good work/life balance”.</p>

<p>In equation form, the day looks like this:</p>

<center>t_work + t_life + t_sleep = 24</center>
<p>where t_work = t_life = t_sleep = 8.</p>

<p>But it is rarely a reflection of how the day <strong><em>feels</em></strong>. What if we change the equation a bit, get a bit relativistic, and add in some “time dilation” constants (disclaimer: not actually relativity, but just roll with it, eh?). These constants will provide a better representation of how time feels, even if the raw hours themselves might be equal.</p>

<p>Here’s the new equation:</p>
<center>c_work * t_work + c_life * t_life + c_sleep * t_sleep = 24</center>
<p>where c_i &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>Let’s take a hypothetical day and see what happens. This day was a rough one. There were multiple deadlines that were due, presentations throughout the day, maybe a code review. All of this whiplash makes it seem as though the day just won’t end. The c_work in this case is large, let’s say 1.5. So, if I actually worked for 8 hours, it felt like 12.</p>

<p>So, 12 out of the 24 hours are already gone.</p>
