    <h1>This Is Living</h1>
<p>25 Dec 2022</p>

<p>I just spend the last two nights in a <a href="https://getaway.house/">Getaway</a>. The ethos of the entire experience is to disconnect, reembrace nature, yourself, and find a new balance.</p>

<p>I’ll be making a lengthier version tomorrow since I want to keep this short tonight.</p>

<p>But I feel like I’ve experienced something primal. Something that braced me by my shoulders, shook me, and said “Hey, wake up. This is living.”</p>

<p>I now want to figure out how to feel that everyday.</p>
