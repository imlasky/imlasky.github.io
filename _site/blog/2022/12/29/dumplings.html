    <h1>Dumplings</h1>

    <p>I’ve been making dumplings at home more recently (pork dumplings, to be exact, but that’s neither here nor there). And I’ve been finding them to be a wondrous joy to make. Taking the time to experiment, practice making the “perfect” dumpling, and using my hands to make something tangible with an immediate pay-off culminates in a rich, human experience.</p>

<p>I’ve started to become aware of brands of wrappers that are better than others because they can’t be pinched as easily, have a little too much flour, or aren’t as stretchy as others.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered some techniques on how best to stuff the dumplings to not leave too much wrapper left over or overstuff them.</p>

<p>I’ve even started to figure out how to make them a bit more decorative with folds.</p>

<p>Granted, these dumplings are not as pretty as the ones you find in a restaurant, <strong><em>but they’re mine</em></strong> - and that makes all the difference.</p>
