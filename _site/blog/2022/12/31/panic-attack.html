    <h1>Panic Attack</h1>
<p>31 Dec 2022</p>

<p>I think I need to move.</p>

<p>Somewhere else.</p>

<p>Somewhere with more green, more air that smells like what candles fail to emulate.</p>

<p>Somewhere I don’t have panic attacks anymore.</p>

<p>Crossing the street shoulder-to-shoulder, hearing the din of multiple overlapping conversations with my mind trying to make sense of each at the same time - I become overwhelmed.</p>

<p>My heart rate increases, my breath becomes shorter - “Get out”. Even as I’m writing this, there are fireworks going off, and I feel a bit claustrophobic despite being in my own apartment.</p>

<p>I find I have more sensitive hearing that most, with it most likely being<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia">misophonia</a>or something similar.</p>

<p>People walking behind me and having their own conversation quickly overtakes my attention to my own conversation. I need to pause and look a different direction when fire engines pass with their sirens on.</p>

<p>I become angry. My fight-or-flight response is activated, I furrow my brow, my face becomes tense, I walk faster - I feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>It’s happened at work too, on the few times I went into the office. A crowded kitchen table combined with poor sound dampening resulted in complete auditory overload and an ensuing panic attack.</p>

<p>I miss out on things because of this: afterparties and going to bars with friends become deeply uncomfortable. Visiting popular areas while traveling mean I want to leave immediately and miss why I went.</p>

<p>Even though there is this thing I struggle with, the bright side is I can listen well. I can detect nuanced changes in someone’s voice, hear if the oven is on by the faint click in the other room, or easily find a phone if it’s on vibrate.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if there’s a lesson here other than the fact that I should change my environment to be one that is more conducive for me.</p>
