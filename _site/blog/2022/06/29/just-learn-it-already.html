    <h1>Just Learn It Already</h1>
<p>29 Jun 2022</p>

<p>So, in my first project post, I complained a bit about all the different web development frameworks and that, frankly, I was struggling with how intimidating they seemed.<a href="/projects/2022/05/31/temp-project-website.html">[1]</a></p>

<p>However, yesterday I finally decided I am just going to learn it already.</p>

<p>Like jumping into cold water for the first time, it seems worse in my head than it actually is. Over time, I think the perceived difficulty built up to be more than it actually is. Sure, I’m not going to be an expert out of the gate, but I think I can get to a point that I can dabble sufficiently.</p>

<p>I suppose I’ll find out.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is a very long-winded way to say that I am essentially starting from scratch with React and Javascript. How’d I pick React? I’m not sure. From what I’ve read, it is one of the most popular frameworks and I might as well start somewhere.</p>
