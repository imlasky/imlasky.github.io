One of us was arguing that work and life is a balance. The other thought that it was not a zero-sum game, but rather the goal is for both to be fulfilling.</p>

<p>And it got me thinking, is there a way to combine these two schools of thought? Can work and life both be a balance <em>and</em> be a non-zero-sum game?</p>

<p>Let’s imagine that I’m able to work exactly 8 hours per day, live life 8 hours per day, and sleep 8 hours per day. Just based on time alone, this appears “balanced”. It is, by the traditional definition, a “good work/life balance”.</p>

<p>In equation form, the day looks like this:</p>

<center>t_work + t_life + t_sleep = 24</center>
<p>where t_work = t_life = t_sleep = 8.</p>

<p>But it is rarely a reflection of how the day <strong><em>feels</em></strong>. What if we change the equation a bit, get a bit relativistic, and add in some “time dilation” constants (disclaimer: not actually relativity, but just roll with it, eh?). These constants will provide a better representation of how time feels, even if the raw hours themselves might be equal.</p>

<p>Here’s the new equation:</p>
<center>c_work * t_work + c_life * t_life + c_sleep * t_sleep = 24</center>
<p>where c_i &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>Let’s take a hypothetical day and see what happens. This day was a rough one. There were multiple deadlines that were due, presentations throughout the day, maybe a code review. All of this whiplash makes it seem as though the day just won’t end. The c_work in this case is large, let’s say 1.5. So, if I actually worked for 8 hours, it felt like 12.</p>

<p>So, 12 out of the 24 hours are already gone.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had a discussion about work and life.

None of that magical, profitability-will-come-later business.</p>

<p>I tried myself to find these companies - I started on Indie Hackers, actually. I went to the Product Page and started just drilling down on each of the products. But it was a slog. Going through each one was just a tremendous effort, and frequently they are not hiring, which makes sense, since they don’t <em>need</em> to unless it really hurts.</p>

<p>The hypothesis is this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A lot of those in the tech community are looking for a more pure experience to business. Something that doesn’t involve chasing new valuations, and overtaking the world.</li>
  <li>Independent companies hire when it hurts. They’ve figured out how to become profitable and certainly want to keep it that way.</li>
  <li>Connecting these two groups together will help give access to more talent to the independent companies and fulfill what the job seekers are looking for.</li>

More of other people’s words. More of other people’s thoughts, ideas, concepts, opinions and tangents.

<p>So, here’s the start for me to become more regular in my own musings; develop my own voice, my own style of writing, and clarify my own thoughts into the aether.</p>

<p>100 days is too round of a number, let’s try 97 days. (It’s also prime, so it’s go that going for it) So, by <strong>checks notes</strong> March 28, 2023, I should have 96 blog posts in addition to this one.</p>

<p>Gaining clarity of thought is my goal, and maybe I’ll find some other things along the way.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been reading more and more lately.

<p>One feelings is a sense of freedom: “I’ve quit that thing that’s been holding me down”. This kind of quitting feels good to the bones like eating chicken soup when you have a cold.</p>

<p>The other kind of feeling is bittersweet and almost reluctant. This kind of quitting is never black and white; it’s a kind of quitting that somehow gives both staying and quitting benefits.</p>

<p>To think about it a bit more objectively, this quitting is an opportunity cost equation: “Am I going to be better off if I quit this thing?”</p>

<p>Traditionally, I’ve been on the side of cut loose and move on; there’ll be more. But lately, I’ve been thinking, maybe I should stick it out and see if there’s something over this hill I’m climbing - something that doesn’t just make me feel like I’m Sisyphus with the boulder.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quitting is a topic that has multiple feelings associated with it depending upon the situation.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Keep Learning That I Know Nothing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/08/01/i-keep-learning-that-i-know-nothing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Keep Learning That I Know Nothing" /><published>2022-08-01T14:42:30-04:00</published><updated>2022-08-01T14:42:30-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/08/01/i-keep-learning-that-i-know-nothing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/08/01/i-keep-learning-that-i-know-nothing.html"><![CDATA[<p>In my<a href="/projects/2022/05/31/temp-project-website.html">first post</a>, I talked a bit about how I was looking at different frameworks when deciding what to use for this simple blog and I</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In myfirst post, I talked a bit about how I was looking at different frameworks when deciding what to use for this simple blog and I]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Crying Helps A Lot</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/07/13/crying-helps-a-lot.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crying Helps A Lot" /><published>2022-07-13T20:00:40-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-13T20:00:40-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/07/13/crying-helps-a-lot</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/07/13/crying-helps-a-lot.html"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps this post might be too personal, but I felt the need to put it down.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on some ideas and found that originality is a rather tough thing to nail down.</p>

<p>Granted, the whole point of this blog is for me to document my temp projects, but even as a way to keep me accountable for them, I find myself almost making <em>more</em> half-finished projects.</p>

<p>For instance, there are a few in my pipeline that I think are good ideas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An app that takes any recipe and puts it into the shopping cart of your choice</li>
  <li>A search engine that is strictly for reviews</li>
  <li>A drag-and-drop platform for data analysis</li>
  <li>An idea to simplify returns (like a reverse last-mile logistics sort of thing)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think there is potential in all of them (some more than others), but yet I find I am just <em>blah</em> about all of them when I get down to it.</p>

<p>However, yesterday I finally decided I am just going to learn it already.</p>

<p>Like jumping into cold water for the first time, it seems worse in my head than it actually is. Over time, I think the perceived difficulty built up to be more than it actually is. Sure, I’m not going to be an expert out of the gate, but I think I can get to a point that I can dabble sufficiently.</p>

<p>I suppose I’ll find out.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is a very long-winded way to say that I am essentially starting from scratch with React and Javascript. How’d I pick React? I’m not sure. From what I’ve read, it is one of the most popular frameworks and I might as well start somewhere.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, in my first project post, I complained a bit about all the different web development frameworks and that, frankly, I was struggling with how intimidating they seemed.[1]]]></summary></entry></feed>
