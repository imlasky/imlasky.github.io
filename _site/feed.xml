<p>And with it, I love cooking.</p>

<p>I know that I can add cream, cheese, basil, tomatoes, and chicken stock to a pan and make a great sauce for salmon.</p>

<p>I know that I can put avocados, tomatoes, onion, lime, cumin, salt, and pepper together to make good guacamole.</p>

<p>I know that I can slowly brown onions, add wine and beef broth to make some tasty onion soup.</p>

<p>It’s all replicable and I can zhuzh it up however I want. Not just salt to taste, but modify to taste.</p>

<p>I’m not a painter or a sculptor; I can’t draw or do photography - but I can cook.</p>

<p>It’s a transient art.</p>

<p>One that doesn’t last forever but is to be experienced.</p>

<p>It can be reproduced, but it won’t be the same meal.</p>

<p>Artful transience. Here for a brief moment to be enjoyed, and then gone.</p>

<p>The same kind of ethereal nature as the sand mandalas created by monks.</p>

<p>The art is the doing, rather than the end result.</p>

<p>In the same way that those mandalas are swept away at the end of their creation, so too are my meals.</p>

<p>I enjoy dismantling my art.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love food.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When Breath Becomes Air</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/books/2023/01/16/when-breath-becomes-air.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When Breath Becomes Air" /><published>2023-01-16T16:21:50-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T16:21:50-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/books/2023/01/16/when-breath-becomes-air</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/books/2023/01/16/when-breath-becomes-air.html"><![CDATA[<p>When Breath Becomes Air is the story of a neurosurgeon who, right near the end of his residency, was diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Breath Becomes Air is the story of a neurosurgeon who, right near the end of his residency, was diagnosed with lung cancer.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Simple Play</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/01/16/simple-play.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Simple Play" /><published>2023-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/01/16/simple-play</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/01/16/simple-play.html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning was the first morning of winter that we had a proper snow. The snow was the perfect snow for snowballs and snowmen.</p>

<p>So, this morning, I went outside, and started rolling snow around. Slowly gathering it at first, but then more gradually until I had a ball that was probably hundreds of pounds. It was a proper workout near the end; essentially needing to do dead lifts to roll the damn thing.</p>

<p>But it was fun.</p>

<p>A pure kind of fun.</p>

<p>The kind of fun that I yearn for when I reminisce about my childhood.</p>

<p>It was simple: roll the ball of snow until I become tired. Maybe stack another on top to make it taller because taller snow is better snow and looks cool.</p>

<p>Why does anything need to be more complicated?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning was the first morning of winter that we had a proper snow.

It’s a great, inexpensive way to get out of the city. Today’s activity was to take the train, head south a bit, and then go for a hike, maybe something with a bit of a view.</p>

<p>We got off the train to find ourselves in a sort of cookie-cutter town on the Boston outskirts. You know the kind - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1">5-over-1 apartments</a>, with the single grocery store, a few generic restaurants, a Michael’s, and a Yankee Candle.</p>

<p>Walking just the expanse of this single parking lot is close to half a mile - pure American bigness, eh? We wanted to grab a quick snack before heading off to hike.</p>

<p>But it turns out, we couldn’t cross the interstate to get to the park. We’d either have to take an Uber, or walk nearly 4 hours. So, we decided to just try a smaller park around - but there was construction.</p>

<p>So, there we were, getting whipped by the cold wind, in an industrial park, in a town I can confuse with hundreds of others, and we decided to just call it a day.</p>

<p>On the way back, we grabbed a pair of WoodWick candles from that single Yankee Candle ‘cause they were half-off (the bergamot and basil is quite delightful).</p>

<p>Anyways, it was a good trip anyways because it was memorable.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Boston, every weekend we have $10 all-you-can-ride tickets for the commuter trains.

I’m going to start with a definition of connection and work from there:</p>

<p><strong><em>Connection</em></strong> (n): <em>a relationship in which a person, thing, or idea is linked or associated with something else.</em></p>

<p>Okay, so there is a relationship between people, things, or ideas. That makes sense. But now the question comes up: how do we connect people, things, or ideas?</p>

<p>Language could be one answer.</p>

<p>Being in close physical proximity is another.</p>

<p>So is being in the same place as someone in the past.</p>

<p>Of course, there are infinitely many more types of connections, but I wanted to illustrate it with these first.</p>

<p>If we take each dimension of connection one at a time, we can start to find interesting limitations to each, with respective opportunities as well.</p>

<p>For the first connection, language, the obvious is the <em>language barrier</em>. Different languages, different cultures, maybe enough to say “hello” to each other but not much else. What is being done within the language barrier space?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language learning apps</li>
  <li>Text to Speech Translation</li>
  <li>Speech to Speech Translation</li>
  <li>Real-time audio translation</li>
</ul>

<p>But it’s still not quite there, is it? I can’t go to Korea and put in my AirPods and instantly understand everything around me. So, there is still work to be done. This is not to say that I don’t think learning a language is valuable in its own right. In fact, I’m learning Korean right now because there are certain phrases there that just don’t have an English translation.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the second type of connection: being in close proximity to each other. Airplanes, cars, trains, boats, bicycles, and buses have certainly made this more feasible to connect over time. But there are still instances where being in close proximity just isn’t feasible. The pandemic made this especially clear, and so a new wave of remote friendly companies aimed at making it <em>feel</em> like you’re close have popped up. But they don’t feel like anything. They feel like yet another app. Another set of lights on the screen.</p>

<p>So, what are we to do? Well, AR/VR certainly have progressed, but until they are not so damn goofy, they will not be mainstream. This is clearly a big area of investment as companies have poured billions into figuring out how to make remote work not completely wreck their “culture”.</p>

<p>Lastly, being in the same place as someone in the past can be an interesting connection. One of the first thoughts I had was about how cave drawings from millennia prior are still on the walls. Some of the earliest paintings were just our hands with paint. The hands look the same. They’re still human. But somehow we feel connected to them, standing where they stood when they made those paintings.</p>

<p>There have been <em>some</em> developments in this space, but I feel it is more open than the others. Most of it is about overlaying historic images on a scene, the same way some ruins have a glass pane you can look through to see the monument as it once stood. But can I see the people passing by? Can I hear the sounds of people during the day?</p>

<p>I think there are <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of interesting concepts than can erupt from mulling over the various dimensions of connection, their limitations, and how we are progressing in overcoming them.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking of connections lately and the various forms they can take.

<p>It’s reaching out from my bones.</p>

<p>I feel it during my walks in the city.</p>

<p>With every time I look at my phone.</p>

<p>Every time I wish to both connect and disconnect.</p>

<p>Every time I wish to do something more with my hands, be more human, make use of the fact that I am a product of evolution and be reminded of the fact that the technology we have is not fully evolved for <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>Why can’t using technology be as calming as breathing in the fresh air near a still lake?</p>

<p>Why can’t using technology be as comforting as eating the first warm bowl of soup when you have a cold?</p>

<p>Why can’t using technology be as uplifting like getting hit by the first rays of sun in Spring?</p>

<p>Why has it become that I need to <em>escape</em> from technology? Did we ever need to escape from hammers, from cars, from refrigerators?</p>

<p>I’m frustrated.</p>

<p>But I feel like the painting is becoming clearer every day with each new brushstroke.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s been this idea swirling in my head, where I can’t quite see the full shapes just yet.
