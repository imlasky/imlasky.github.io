<p>I read a post a little while ago on Bearblog called <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/mvp-vs-slc/">“Why products should be ‘slick’, not just viable”</a>, and it really resonated with me.</p>

<p>Instead of using MVP (minimum viable product) as the measure of an incremental unit of a product, he uses SLC (simple, lovable, and complete). In essence, SLC is the idea that the product should be complete from the onset – that even though there <em>could</em> be more added to the product, it doesn’t necessarily need to in order to operate as its main function.</p>

<p>However, the key difference between SLC and MVP, in my eyes, is the L – lovable. Take, for instance, ChatGPT. It’s a cha box. That’s it. Chat has been around forever. The design is not new.</p>

<p>But it’s lovable. It was (until Threads, maybe) the fastest growing service ever because it was just that good.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-the-only-user">I am the only user</h2>
<p>There’s another idea that also resonated - <a href="https://blubsblog.bearblog.dev/i-am-the-only-user/">being the only user.</a>From this one, I gained the insight that my products that I have developed previously were for some ephemeral “user” that I thought I identified with. However, when developing the product, I quickly became aware that I wouldn’t use it ever, let alone <em>pay</em> for it.</p>

<p>So, I started to truly look for problems in my own life, ones that I actually become angry at because “why is it like this? How has there been <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> to solve this yet?”</p>

<p>I’ve found 2 problems and because they were truly <em>my</em> problems, I was able to quickly solve them. (I’ll make a couple project posts about them soon)</p>

<h2 id="bringing-it-together">Bringing it together</h2>

<p>The last thing I have learned is that it really is that these two concepts work in tandem with each other. To build something SLC, I first have to build something that I would love. It doesn’t have to be complete for me, but I should make sure that it is complete for others, if I want to share it, without ruining the simplicity of the hacky solution.</p>

<p>So, first develop for yourself and solve your pain points. Then keep the simplicity and make it lovable to use.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[SLC - Simple, Lovable, and Complete I read a post a little while ago on Bearblog called “Why products should be ‘slick’, not just viable”, and it really resonated with me.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Still Alive</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/05/01/still-alive.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Still Alive" /><published>2023-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/05/01/still-alive</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/05/01/still-alive.html"><![CDATA[<p>Went to Italy.

<blockquote>
  <p>Take breaks, not stops</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took a break from writing everyday. I found I became very in my head, tossing things around that, while yes they were good to get down, made me ruminate too much and put me into a bit of a hole.</p>

<p>I’m back now and feeling refreshed.</p>

<p>I have a trip to Italy in less than two weeks, where I hope to make my sense of self even more whole.</p>

<p>A new idea has been stuck in my brain, one about learning. It is similar to the flashcard project idea I had, but a little more expansive. I’ll create a post of that separately.</p>

<hr />

<p>Other benefits that I have noticed about myself have been that I have not stepped on the scale once. It has brought a new kind of peace to myself. Where I don’t tie myself to a number and don’t let it define me. I have been going to the gym, feeling stronger each day, eating better, and embracing the difference day by day.</p>

<p>I have to remind myself that this is my year of simplicity. My year of embracing how simple things can prove the most enjoyable - how the simple things are the ones that end up making me happier all around.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my friends told me about a quote:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sourdough Part 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/03/01/sourdough-part-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sourdough Part 2" /><published>2023-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/03/01/sourdough-part-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/03/01/sourdough-part-2.html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s alive!

He’s a well-known therapist in Hollywood, but that was the first I’ve ever heard of him. And frankly, the ideas presented are going to help me change things.</p>

<p>Even from just watching, hearing the phrasing about the Shadow, and relating to Hill that my shadow is a younger, overweight self, it finally clicked to have compassion for that self. It is a part of me. My Shadow would feel bad for how I have thought of him. I feel bad for thinking of him the same way others may have thought of him, despite knowing him the best.</p>

<p>I also downloaded his two audio books, The Tools and Coming Alive, written with Barry Michels. I plan to take these tools into practice.</p>

<p>It’ll take a bit of adjustment to the language, which frankly sounds a little loopy. But hey, most ideas sound loopy before you try them. Especially the good ones.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decided to watch the movie Stutz, which is about Jonah Hill’s therapist, Phil Stutz.
