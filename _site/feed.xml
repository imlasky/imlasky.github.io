Just a little bit. I felt a path that I had not felt in a while, something that says “that way looks pretty good, let’s take that route”.</p>

<p>I recognized a truth about myself: I like data science, but I don’t love it. What I do really enjoy, and finding myself consistently defaulting to, is the visuals. Data visualization.</p>

<p>And today, I found others. I found others that are the same way. I read a blog post by<a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/about/">Nadieh Bremer</a>detailing her journey towards what she does now - and it is damn near identical.</p>

<ol>
  <li>She studied astronomy (I studied aerospace engineering)</li>
  <li>Didn’t want to do the Ph.D, but did the master’s (same),</li>
  <li>Went to consulting at Deloitte as a data scientist (I did consulting and data science at a boutique consulting firm)</li>
  <li>Became disenchanted with data science</li>
</ol>

<p>But then she said in her post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then I went to a presentation by Mike Freeman. On his title slide it said Data Visualization Specialist. And it was as if I’d been hit by lighting. that’s a thing on its own?! You can specialize in data visualization?!”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now I am having that same epiphany. I don’t know where it will lead, if I will end up doing it forever, but it is a path, a light, something to give me a good place to place my next step.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I saw ahead.

And it has resulted in an unhealthy relationship with the scale.</p>

<p>I look at the number and I become happy or sad.</p>

<p>That’s not a good way to live.</p>

<p>So, today, the first day back at the gym in a <em>while</em>, I decided I want to measure my progress in other ways. These can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How I feel that day</li>
  <li>How my shirts feel on my body</li>
  <li>How frequently I am out of breath</li>
  <li>My hunger levels throughout the day</li>
  <li>Whether I begin to seek more physically-engaging activities</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in keeping with my simplicity them, I want to really start to listen to my body, feel how it reacts each day, and take better care of it, rather than reducing all of my joy, or ability to experience joy, down to a single number I see in the morning.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve struggled with my weight a bunch over the years - with it going up and going down.
