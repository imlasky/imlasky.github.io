As expected, all of our friends brought food, in addition to the food that we bought for the party: cupcakes, Oreos, chips, pretzels, candy, candy corn, and a ton of booze.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that everyone was mostly craving savory things (chips, pretzels, etc.) and not so much sweet things (cupcakes, candy). So, we were left with all of that the next day.</p>

<p>I found myself going to the kitchen multiple times to nibble on a double-stuff Oreo or two. A cupcake at noon and after dinner.</p>

<p>And then I caught myself – what am I doing? Why am I eating this?</p>

<p>I didn’t feel any joy from eating these things. I have been struggling with weight and I am just fighting against myself here.</p>

<p>So, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a trash bag, and one after another began tossing out the cupcakes and cookies that were left. I didn’t want them in my sight or in the house because I just couldn’t resist them.</p>

<p>I felt good about getting it out of the house and would rather toss it out than put it in my body anymore.</p>

<p>It was a good step forward for me and felt like a stake in the ground that I have had enough of how I’m eating.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Friday we hosted a Halloween party.

<p>There is this concept in it that I found rather insightful: the “liking gap”.</p>

<p>The “liking gap” is the concept that how much we perceive someone likes us is usually an underestimate of how much they actually do.</p>

<p>This can be translated into a number of scenarios.</p>

<p>For me, I’ve used this when chatting to people at events – I assume they’d like to chat and are open to connection.</p>

<p>I approach them, say hello and introduce myself, and ask a question.</p>

<p>Most recently I was at a Bahamas concert and noticed a few people next to me.</p>

<p>They weren’t initiating, so I remembered what I read about the liking gap. So, I initiated and we connected over our love of the band and chatted about their new album – it was a great connection!</p>

<p>Another recent connection is a friend I’ve been emailing back and forth with after finding their blog. I was interested in their story, and felt I could maybe offer some advice for their situation. It’s been fun so far to encourage them to start a project and to also reflect on how much I’ve grown with my technical knowledge from my own projects.</p>

<p>The best part of all this is that it is <em>repeatable</em> and <em>practicable</em>. I can do it whenever, wherever, make new connections, meet new people, learn about them and their world and maybe, just maybe, foster a new friendship.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been reading a book lately called Platonic (shout out to the Boston Public Library’s discover section).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Guava</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2023/10/27/guava.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Guava" /><published>2023-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2023/10/27/guava</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2023/10/27/guava.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m traveling soon. World travels. Maybe for a year or two. And, as one does, I’m going to make a blog.</p>

<p>While Jekyll has been good to me for this blog, what I want is something that is more flexible, and something I don’t have to write in markdown in VSCode and push changes.</p>

<p>No, I want dead-easy, drag-and-drop, flexible, mobile-friendly, and <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>I want to be able to move images where I want them, add sounds of city streets as someone reads a post, be able to draw arrows right on the page to point to something interesting.</p>

<p>I want to be able to keep my family and friends up to date when a new post is there and know where I am in the world, give them the ability to add suggestions – make posts <em>multiplayer</em>.</p>

<p>There are a few platforms out there that embody similar ideals, and I’m trying to create a mashup of them.</p>

<p>My inspiration is coming from sites like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mmm.page">mmm.page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear Blog</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s get cracking!</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="october-27-2023">October 27, 2023</h3>

<p>I’ve already laid the groundwork for text and images. Namely, I’ve been able to integrate the TipTap editor into a new element, and select images.</p>

<p>Things like copy/paste, delete, resize, and drag to position are also in.</p>

<p>The main challenge right now is getting the elements to look right on both desktop and mobile. The idea is be able to specify where I’d want the element to be on the desktop and where I want it on mobile, if at all. Something like visual breakpoints for each element. By default, it would be a fixed element that, as the screen size shrinks, it goes off the page if outside the bounds.</p>

You might have seen it floating around the internet as a Venn diagram with 4 circles: what you love, what you’re good at, what you can be paid for, and what the world needs.</p>

<p>It’s a concept I’ve been wrestling with – is this something that is sought out actively or one that occurs naturally? My answer has been slowly shaping towards 30% of the first and 70% of the second.</p>

<p>As a bit of a tangent, there’s a famous psychiatrist Dr. Phil Stutz who popularized the idea of one’s “life force”, pictured as a pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid you have body, in the middle you have relationships, and at the top you have self.</p>

<p>When lost or in search of meaning, focusing on one or more of these levels is a way to keep movement in your life.</p>

<p>Focus on your body: start eating better, run, sleep, go outside and feel the sun warm your face – anything to get the body moving and feeling good.</p>

<p>Enrich and strengthen your relationships with others: seek out those who you want to feel connected to, show up for each other.</p>

<p>And finally, work on yourself: improve your skills, learn something new, tangential, unrelated to anything else. Focus on broadening values and experiences.</p>

<p>I’ve really been in a rut lately and have had to remind myself that things have always happened for me when I focused on my “life force” first and that I need to trust in myself. Because it is only through doing that, that I feel I can find what my own ikigai is.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ikigai is a Japanese concept that roughly translates to “a reason for being”.

<p>We’re so happy that you expressed your interest in joining <strong>tech.ai</strong> — the leading AI company transforming the {industry} industry (and is <em>definitely not</em> just an API call to OpenAI)!</p>

<p>We have received your application and are happy to move you on to the first round which is a take-home assignment which shouldn’t take you more than 2-3 weeks. We hope you have as much fun completing it as we have had designing it! It’s designed to test a variety of skills such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>perseverance</li>
  <li>obedience</li>
  <li>how much shit you can take</li>
  <li>your desperation for a job</li>
  <li>coding!</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve attached the prompt for the first round to this email, it’s a quick 22 page read to give you sufficient background into the problem. (Hint: don’t forget the quirk on page 17!).</p>

<p>The expected output is a report document that is expected to contain UML diagrams, Figma wireframes, burndown charts of your progress, a picture of a pony, and a detailed document of your approach and reasoning for each line of code. Additionally, we expect the project to be completed in both python 2.7 and 3.11 - we advise creating a docker image of your project so we can run it on our end.</p>

<p>To give you a peek at the rest of the process - we’ve optimized it for speed since we are <strong>urgently hiring</strong>. So, if you are deemed worthy enough to pass the first stage, the rest of the interview process will look like the following (subject to change):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Recruiter phone screen to go over your resume [30 min]</li>
  <li>Live coding and behavioral interview [60 min]</li>
  <li>Chat with Product Manager [45 min]</li>
  <li>Second take-home assignment [2-3 weeks]</li>
  <li>Review of first and second take-home assignments [10 min]</li>
  <li>Behavioral interview with principal engineer [30 mins]</li>
  <li>Third take-home assignment [2-3 weeks]</li>
  <li>Presentation of third take-home to hiring panel [3 hours]</li>
  <li>Meet and greet with other engineers [60 min]</li>
  <li>2 month paid working trial [2 months]</li>
  <li>Chat with CPO [60 mins]</li>
  <li>Wait 2 weeks while we see if there is someone else [2 weeks]</li>
  <li>Offer!</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve carefully crafted all 13 steps above to help make the process easy and ensure that there is a good fit — the hiring process goes both ways, after all!</p>

<p>Due to the high volume of applicants, we can’t guarantee that we’ll get back to you with detailed feedback of your take-home assignment, but we’ll make sure to maybe skim some of the first page.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your interest in tech.ai! We can’t wait to have you on board.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>{recruiter}</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, {applicant}!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Resgen</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2023/08/14/resgen.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Resgen" /><published>2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2023/08/14/resgen</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2023/08/14/resgen.html"><![CDATA[<p>Will do a more formal writeup at some point, but the project is here: <a href="https://resgen.app">Resgen</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="projects" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will do a more formal writeup at some point, but the project is here: Resgen]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We need more whimsical products</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/07/26/whimsy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We need more whimsical products" /><published>2023-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/07/26/whimsy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/07/26/whimsy.html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever seen Maxim Vengerov play?

<p>Okay, I mostly just wanted to share some of my favorite violinists, but I also wanted to talk about <em>why</em> I like them so much and how that reason also propagates into why I like certain products just the same.</p>

<p>If you look closely, each of these violinists have a certain whimsical nature to their playing. This isn’t to say their playing is funny, but it’s playful (even for such an intense piece as Ysaye 3), it has an interest to it that’s plastered all over their face in their playing and then rebounds into their sound - it’s electric to watch. If you have a few spare moments, I really encourage you to take some time to watch the performances above.</p>

<p>Whether it was this whimsical nature that has made them stand out originally, or it came out <em>because</em> they’re so good, I don’t know. But I am willing to bet that it is more of the former than the latter.</p>

<p>This same idea translates directly to some products I enjoy using just because the creator took the time to add in some whimsy to it. One I quite like, and use regularly, is Pocketbase. Let’s look:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2023-07-26-whimsy/pocketbase.gif" alt="pocketbase" /></p>

<p>How fun is that! Let’s take a look at another. Here’s Bearblog:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2023-07-26-whimsy/bearblog.gif" alt="bearblog" /></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at a third - Posthog. I mean, just <em>look</em> at their homepage, whimsy is all over the place and I’m here for it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2023-07-26-whimsy/posthog1.png" alt="posthog1" />
<img src="/assets/images/2023-07-26-whimsy/posthog2.png" alt="posthog2" />
<img src="/assets/images/2023-07-26-whimsy/posthog3.png" alt="posthog3" />
<img src="/assets/images/2023-07-26-whimsy/posthog4.png" alt="posthog4" /></p>

<p>Software can come across so serious sometimes, but when I think the products that really appeal to me, they are ones that don’t take themselves so seriously. It adds some humanity and fun back into the software world. If you know of more products that have whimsy like this, I’d love to hear about them!</p>

<p>Okay, just one more because the sites made on it really capture that early internet aesthetic: <a href="https://mmm.page">mmm.page</a></p>

(Warning, there will be spoilers)</p>

<p>It’s climactic ending where Andrew plays at the JVC is always gripping to watch. If you aren’t familiar and don’t mind spoilers, Andrew is initially fooled by Fletcher that he will play the standard charts he’s used to back at school. Instead, an unfamiliar chart is put in front of him, and he flounders when he doesn’t know the chart.</p>

<p>Andrew storms off of the stage to an embrace from his father, only to return to the stage moments after.</p>

<p>It’s this part that I love.</p>

<p>He comes back on stage and there’s a coolness about him - an air of “fuck you, I will do what I want.” And I just <em>love</em> it. He takes command of the one-way power dynamic that has been presented the whole movie and, instead of Fletcher determining the situation, Andrew is in charge.</p>

<p>The father, just on the side of the stage and after being doubtful of the path his son is on all movie, finally “gets it” how his son is great - how he is consumed by his passion, maybe obsessed.</p>

<p>There’s a single shot that I think about a lot. It’s where Andrew is playing his solo, and there is a shot of the bass drum rocking back and forth. It’s maybe a 1 second shot, if that. And with the sound of the drums, it feels like it’s a car pushing its absolute limits, with the motor whirring at peak RPM. It’s stable, but by just a hair. It’s physically showing just how at the limit he is.</p>

<p>I aspire to be at the limits of something, pushing the boundaries and bringing something into this world that did not exist before.</p>

<p>Sure, these are just words and the work is in the doing. But god dammit, I’m trying.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think one of my favorite movies has to be Whiplash.

<p>I read a post a little while ago on Bearblog called <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/mvp-vs-slc/">“Why products should be ‘slick’, not just viable”</a>, and it really resonated with me.</p>

<p>Instead of using MVP (minimum viable product) as the measure of an incremental unit of a product, he uses SLC (simple, lovable, and complete). In essence, SLC is the idea that the product should be complete from the onset – that even though there <em>could</em> be more added to the product, it doesn’t necessarily need to in order to operate as its main function.</p>

<p>However, the key difference between SLC and MVP, in my eyes, is the L – lovable. Take, for instance, ChatGPT. It’s a cha box. That’s it. Chat has been around forever. The design is not new.</p>

<p>But it’s lovable. It was (until Threads, maybe) the fastest growing service ever because it was just that good.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-the-only-user">I am the only user</h2>
<p>There’s another idea that also resonated - <a href="https://blubsblog.bearblog.dev/i-am-the-only-user/">being the only user.</a>From this one, I gained the insight that my products that I have developed previously were for some ephemeral “user” that I thought I identified with. However, when developing the product, I quickly became aware that I wouldn’t use it ever, let alone <em>pay</em> for it.</p>

<p>So, I started to truly look for problems in my own life, ones that I actually become angry at because “why is it like this? How has there been <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> to solve this yet?”</p>

<p>I’ve found 2 problems and because they were truly <em>my</em> problems, I was able to quickly solve them. (I’ll make a couple project posts about them soon)</p>

<h2 id="bringing-it-together">Bringing it together</h2>

<p>The last thing I have learned is that it really is that these two concepts work in tandem with each other. To build something SLC, I first have to build something that I would love. It doesn’t have to be complete for me, but I should make sure that it is complete for others, if I want to share it, without ruining the simplicity of the hacky solution.</p>

<p>So, first develop for yourself and solve your pain points. Then keep the simplicity and make it lovable to use.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[SLC - Simple, Lovable, and Complete I read a post a little while ago on Bearblog called “Why products should be ‘slick’, not just viable”, and it really resonated with me.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Still Alive</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/05/01/still-alive.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Still Alive" /><published>2023-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/05/01/still-alive</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/05/01/still-alive.html"><![CDATA[<p>Went to Italy.
