    <h1>Metasearcher</h1>
<p>16 Jun 2022</p>

<p>There have been a decent amount of observations about needing to add <em>site:reddit</em> to Google searches to get the desired result. <a href="https://future.com/the-future-of-search-is-boutique/">[1]</a><a href="https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying">[2]</a> I also frequently use this tactic to see reviews on even the most mundane things, like water bottles or toasters.</p>

<p>However, this got me thinking if there’s a better way to amass communal knowledge into a more digestible presentation. That is, for sites like Reddit, message boards, tutorials, etc. is there a good way to distill all of it down to answer a subjective question as objectively as possible?</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Okay, so first things first: I want to narrow the problem space a bit and focus on a single portion of search that I find kind of meh: finding recipes.</p>

<p>Let’s start with one of my favorite dishes: paella. I go to Google, search for <em>paella recipes</em> and get this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/metasearch/paella.png" alt="Paella search result" /></p>

<p>Let’s break what we have:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/metasearch/paella_color_coded.png" alt="Paella search result color coded" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>In magenta, Google says that it has about 30,300,000 results for paella recipes. Hot damn, that’s a lot.</li>
  <li>In green, the first result appears with:
    <ul>
      <li>the title of the dish with the website it comes from</li>
      <li>a very rough (and incomplete) description of how to make paella in the description</li>
      <li>a rating of 4.9 stars with 375 votes</li>
      <li>a cook time of 1 hour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In blue, we have 2 other recipes along with the first result recipe. Each have:
    <ul>
      <li>the title of the recipe</li>
      <li>which website the recipe is from</li>
      <li>a rating and number of votes</li>
      <li>cook times</li>
      <li>a rough (and incomplete) list of ingredients</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In red are related questions – I was only able to get the first related question in the screenshot, but it’ll do.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to recap, by searching for paella recipe, I was met with a number I don’t care about and 3 recipes with incomplete instructions and/or ingredient lists.</p>

<p>From this point, the normal order of operations, at least for me, is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the first link</li>
  <li>Read the recipe and list of ingredients</li>
  <li>Go back</li>
  <li>Click a link with a higher number of reviews, maybe?</li>
  <li>Read through that recipe</li>
  <li>“Wait, what did the other recipe call for?”</li>
  <li>Go back</li>
  <li>“Oh, got it.”</li>
  <li>Go back</li>
  <li>Click 3rd recipe to see if there is a pattern</li>
  <li>Go back</li>
  <li>Click second recipe because I like the instructions more.</li>
</ol>

<p>I just want the damn recipe, maybe with some tips baked in.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Combine all the recipes together!</p>

<p>Okay, so clearly, that is a <em>gross</em> simplification, but surely there are bits and pieces of each recipe that are common enough that we can start to create a semblence of a general consensus?</p>

<p>I guess we’ll find out!</p>

<p>In more detail, what I’d like to do is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Index all the recipes from every recipe site</li>
  <li>Create a similarity ranking for recipes</li>
  <li>Train a model on how to cook a dish based upon the collective instructions</li>
  <li>Wrap it up in a nice interface</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope the outcome is a way that I can search for a recipe, and the result is a recipe with some added “cool tips” along the way, maybe. I’d also like if it listed the sources that contributed most to the recipe, so I can go see the original recipes.</p>

<p>Seems easy enough with absolutely no potential pitfalls at all.</p>

<h2 id="proving-the-idea">Proving the idea</h2>

<p>Going along with the paella theme, I first want to get some recipes. I’ll deal with indexing, compiling, and web scraping later. Let me first just figure out if I can have a computer combine these recipes for me.</p>
