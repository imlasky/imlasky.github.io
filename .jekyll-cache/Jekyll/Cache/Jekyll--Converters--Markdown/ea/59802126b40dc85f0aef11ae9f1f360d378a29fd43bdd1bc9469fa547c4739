I"t<p>I’ve been making dumplings at home more recently (pork dumplings, to be exact, but that’s neither here nor there). And I’ve been finding them to be a wondrous joy to make. Taking the time to experiment, practice making the “perfect” dumpling, and using my hands to make something tangible with an immediate pay-off culminates in a rich, human experience.</p>
