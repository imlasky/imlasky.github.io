<p>Hey there - Iâ€™m Ian. You know when you start a new project and canâ€™t think of a name, and instead call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp</code> or something? This is my collection of those.</p>

<p>Often times these projects start with the best of intentions, but usually come when Iâ€™m working on something else I thought was exciting. The result is a bunch of projects named like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp-project_2022-02-22_v1</code> with no other description. Iâ€™m left wading through some half-baked code just until a new idea pops into my head, causing me to create a new project - this time I intentionally called it <strong>Temp Project</strong>.</p>
