I"Ä<p>Iâ€™ve been doing intermittent fasting for a few days now and, expectedly, I become hungry and hyper-aware of the time near the end of the fasting window.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t the first time I have done intermittent fasting - in fact, itâ€™s actually close to how I naturally eat. I forget to eat some meals sometimes, so IF more or less systemizes what I do naturally.</p>

<p>To counteract me being hyper-aware of the time, I have tried to figure out different ways to distract myself of the time, make my mind focus on something else. Today, I went for a walk, plugged in to an audiobook, and walked it out. I found that my hunger sort of decreased as I was walking, almost to the point where I couldnâ€™t feel any hunger at all.</p>

<p>When I came back, though, I was ravenous. I have since learned that I need foods that are quick to eat. I do not have tons of patience to cook while I am hungry like that.</p>

<p>But Iâ€™ve been thinking of how I can translate this skill of distracting myself to steer away from a feeling into other domains. For instance, how I can I reorient myself when I am feeling frustrated? Or sad? Or lethargic? I have a feeling that walking might help with most, but maybe there are some other tools. I have traditionally turned to eating, but that really isnâ€™t the best way to always deal with these things and can create a spiral.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was a good fast today. Itâ€™s getting easier and Iâ€™m feeling better each day.</p>
