I"F<p>Today I went to Walden Pond. Itâ€™s a bit of a famous body of water here in Massachusetts as it was home to Henry David Thoreau for over two years. (2 years, 2 months, and 2 days, to be exact) He actually lived in a little cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson who allowed Thoreau to conduct his experiment there.</p>
