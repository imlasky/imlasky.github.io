<p>The idea came from me looking for a job myself. I became disenchanted trying to find a job from a non-VC-backed company. It was (and still is) legitimately difficult to do so. So, I thought: what if there was a way to find private companies that are profitable and looking to grow? None of that magical, profitability-will-come-later business that is so frequent with VC-backed startups.</p>

<p>I tried myself to find these companies - I started on Indie Hackers, actually. I went to the Product Page and started just drilling down on each of the products. But it was a slog. Going through each one was just a tremendous effort, and frequently they are not hiring, which makes sense, since they don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to unless it really hurts.</p>

<p>So, my hypothesis is that in this two-sided marketplace, there are these characteristics of the job seekers and the companies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a growing sentiment in the tech community to look for more meaningful work rather than just chasing the salaries. Something that doesn‚Äôt involve going after new valuations, overtaking the world, and can provide a good balance.</li>
  <li>Independent companies hire when it hurts. They‚Äôve figured out how to become profitable and certainly want to keep it that way.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-i-plan-to-build-it">How I plan to build it</h3>

<p>I plan to built it using<a href="https://phoenixproject.org">Phoenix.</a> It is, in part, a way to learn more about Elixir and Phoenix, but also to incorporate some little ‚Äúhey, that‚Äôs kinda cool‚Äù effects along the way that I know would be a pain in the ass otherwise.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm taking inspiration from<a href="https://japan-dev.com">Japan Dev</a> and<a href="https://remoteok.com">Remote | OK</a>, borrowing a bit from each. Namely, I like Remoteok‚Äôs idea of first finding jobs to populate and become, essentially, a link aggregator initially to build the job-seeker side of the market. But I also like Japan Dev‚Äôs idea of being paid <em>after</em> the applicant gets the job, making it lower-stakes for the companies to post.</p>

<p>As for monetization, I want to eventually rely solely on companies posting their jobs, and maybe some add-on services like visibility boosts. But I‚Äôm not worried about that right now. I just want people using it.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm giving myself a month to try to flesh out a working prototype, source the jobs, and get people on the platform using it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be adding updates here as I continue to build. Here we go!</p>

<h3 id="jan-3">Jan 3</h3>

<p>I spent the majority of today trying to get my head around Phoenix. It‚Äôs pretty much like drinking from a firehose, I‚Äôll admit. So, I decided, that for at least this first project, I want to focus on figuring out how to push it out fast and get people using it.</p>

<p>So, I switched back to SvelteKit (which just reached 1.0!), and make a quick mock-up of functionality. Took about 45 minutes or so.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/indiecompjobs/screenshot-2023-01-03.png" alt="Indie Comp Screenshot" /></p>

<p>I linked it up with a new (to me) ORM,<a href="https://www.prisma.io">Prisma</a>, to get some initial data flow, and it works like a charm. I can add to the database as I need, collect emails and do what I need with them.</p>

<p>The thing I want to tackle tomorrow is dealing with a bit of authentication, since I don‚Äôt want just anyone being able to post to the job board.</p>

<p>I also found some sources to find independent companies, or bootstrapped companies on <a href="https://dealroom.co">dealroom.co</a>. Their suite and jobs leave a lot to be desired and it is difficult to navigate to the point I was actually able to see the bootstrap companies. I‚Äôll continue searching for other ways to find these companies and start creating a list of them to look for jobs (both for myself and the board).</p>

<h3 id="jan-4">Jan 4</h3>

<p>Well, it is deployed! (Kind of)</p>

<p>As a summary, today I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did a visual overhaul (seen below)</li>
  <li>Added in filter functionality for tags</li>
  <li>Added in some nice little visual cues for where to click (like on the apply button, for instance)</li>
  <li>Set up a CockroachDB</li>
  <li>Deployed to Vercel</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the deployment was relatively easy - but it was a bit of a learning curve still. I have deployed other projects before (which were much harder), so this was easy in comparison. I feel like there should still be an easier way to do it, but I don‚Äôt really know enough about it yet for how I‚Äôd go about doing it.</p>

<p>I did some more visual adjustments - I find these to be the most enjoyable of all. I can‚Äôt paint, but figuring out how to get things to look exactly as I want them is as close as I will get to being a good painter. However, it still feels as thought it is missing <em>something</em> - some zhuzh. I think the blank white (or off-white) is really throwing me. I‚Äôll keep hacking at it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/indiecompjobs/screenshot-2023-01-04.png" alt="New HomePage" /></p>

<p>For tomorrow, my plan is to finish up the looks and start populating with actual data. I already know it will take some time to do this (currently only able to really do it via the Prisma studio), so maybe I‚Äôll make a page to create posts (both for me and as well as for future employers).</p>

<h3 id="january-5">January 5</h3>

<p>Today was a bit uneventful. Rearranged how the svelte files look. Also been debating going for a pure minimalism kind of feel. Something along the lines of<a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bearblog</a>.</p>

<p>I want it to be solely focused on the job, the company, and the position. Nothing else, no fluff. So, maybe I‚Äôll try to whip up something similar tomorrow. Maybe I‚Äôll go back to Django for this? Thinking down the line, authentication is a bit underdeveloped within the SvelteKit community (although I still need to give<a href="https://vercel.com/blog/announcing-sveltekit-auth">SvelteKit Auth</a> a try).</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see if I can really bare-bones the site tomorrow. I want it crisp and minimal, but not unpolished (if that makes sense).</p>

<h3 id="january-6">January 6</h3>

<p>Okay - so, I know I restarted this project like 3 times now, all with different frameworks, but I redid it again with Django. Just all django. Really simply. I borrowed a lot of inspiration from Bear blog, like I mentioned yesterday, and frankly, I am a huge fan of how it is looking. I mean just look at this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/indiecompjobs/screenshot-2023-01-06.png" alt="Minimalist screen shot" /></p>

<p>The other one - before, felt‚Ä¶cheap? Like a site I would accidentally get redirected to while trying to find a movie for free and I click on the wrong play button. But this, just the simple html (even with a dark mode), feels, for lack of a better term, pure. (I know, I kinda got nauseous writing that too.)</p>

<p>Anyways, the benefit of this is that Django‚Äôs auth is all batteries included. I have Sendgrid set up, emails working great, and able to use Django‚Äôs admin panel to add things manually to start.</p>

<p>Still trying to figure out the best way to transition from posting things myself to setting up payment, but I suppose that is putting the cart before the horse. Anyways, glad I got it to this stage (again) today.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs live at https://indiecompjobs.com, too.</p>
