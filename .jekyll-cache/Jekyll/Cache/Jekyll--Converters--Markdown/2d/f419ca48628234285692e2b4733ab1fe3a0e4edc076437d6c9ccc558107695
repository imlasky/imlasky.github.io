I"Å<p>Perhaps this post might be too personal, but I felt the need to put it down.</p>

<p>I cried a few nights ago.</p>

<p>I cried because I‚Äôve realized that most day-to-day tasks are just too much for me to handle.</p>

<p>Clothes stack up.</p>

<p>The dishes remain dirty.</p>

<p>Returns are still sitting on my doorstep, way past due.</p>

<p>It all just seems impenetrable.</p>
