I"£<p>Today I went to Walden Pond. Itâ€™s a bit of a famous body of water here in Massachusetts as it was home to Henry David Thoreau for over two years. (2 years, 2 months, and 2 days, to be exact) He actually lived in a little cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson who allowed Thoreau to conduct his experiment there.</p>

<p>At Walden Pond is where he wrote down his thoughts about life, which were compiled into a book of the same name. I bought that book today.</p>

<p>I walked along the edge of the pond, all the way around. It was clear and crisp with fresh winter air. The kind of air that makes for a good nightâ€™s sleeps.</p>

<p>I skipped rocks.</p>

<p>I broke icicles into little pieces.</p>

<p>I listened to my footsteps on the forest floor, hearing how the pitch changes depending upon if I focus on my left foot first or my right.</p>

<p>I wondered whether I could live so simply.</p>

<p>Is this for me?</p>
