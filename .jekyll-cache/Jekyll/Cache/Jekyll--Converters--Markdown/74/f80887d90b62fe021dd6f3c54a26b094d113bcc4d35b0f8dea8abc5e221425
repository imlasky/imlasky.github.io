I"ä<p>I think one of my favorite movies has to be Whiplash. (Warning, there will be spoilers)</p>

<p>Itâ€™s climactic ending where Andrew plays at the JVC is always gripping to watch. If you arenâ€™t familiar and donâ€™t mind spoilers, Andrew is initially fooled by Fletcher that he will play the standard charts heâ€™s used to back at school. Instead, an unfamiliar chart is put in front of him, and he flounders when he doesnâ€™t know the chart.</p>

<p>Andrew storms off of the stage to an embrace from his father, only to return to the stage moments after.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s this part that I love.</p>

<p>He comes back on stage and thereâ€™s a coolness about him - an air of â€œfuck you, I will do what I want.â€ And I just <em>love</em> it. He takes command of the one-way power dynamic that has been presented the whole movie and, instead of Fletcher determining the situation, Andrew is in charge.</p>

<p>The father, just on the side of the stage and after being doubtful of the path his son is on all movie, finally â€œgets itâ€ how his son is great - how he is consumed by his passion, maybe obsessed.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a single shot that I think about a lot. Itâ€™s where Andrew is playing his solo, and there is a shot of the bass drum rocking back and forth. Itâ€™s maybe a 1 second shot, if that. And with the sound of the drums, it feels like itâ€™s a car pushing its absolute limits, with the motor whirring at peak RPM. Itâ€™s stable, but by just a hair. Itâ€™s physically showing just how at the limit he is.</p>

<p>I aspire to be at the limits of something, pushing the boundaries and bringing something into this world that did not exist before.</p>

<p>Sure, these are just words and the work is in the doing. But god dammit, Iâ€™m trying.</p>
