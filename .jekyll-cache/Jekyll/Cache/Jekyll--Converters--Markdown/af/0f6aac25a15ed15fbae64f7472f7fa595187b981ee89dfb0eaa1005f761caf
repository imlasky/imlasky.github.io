I"‹<p>Violin has been a part of my life for a little over 3 years now.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve gone through 4 of the Suzuki books and Iâ€™m currently working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkmxC8UXPMM">J.S. Bach: Sonata for Violin Solo No. 3 in C Major, BWV 1005 - III. Largo</a>.</p>

<p>The piece is classic Bach â€“ clear, beautiful, melodic lines, with intervals that are unforgiving.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this is a tough piece for me.</p>

<p>Making progress has been rough up until my last lesson.</p>

<p>She imparted some wisdom that extends beyond just violin and something Iâ€™ve been thinking about since.</p>

<p>In itâ€™s simplest form, she said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focus on the detail to enjoy the beauty during the process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to hear the gorgeous lines that Bach has crafted in its entirety, and so I was practicing like that.</p>

<p>But to properly learn to play it, I need to work from the details up.</p>

<p>â€œHow should this interval sound?â€</p>

<p>â€œHow does my finger feel when I play this double stop?â€</p>

<p>â€œCan I move my wrist to make this transition more comfortable?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat if I put my second finger down first?â€</p>

<p>â€œHow much hair should my bow have here?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhere do I want to be in the bow?â€</p>

<p>I should take enjoyment in the minutiae of crafting the piece from the ground up, almost walking in Bachâ€™s footsteps as he wrote the piece.</p>

<p>Feel how the notes fit together â€“ how the phrase is built and rises from simple notes.</p>

<p>Today was the first day I really put this new perspective into my practice â€“ I was fired up.</p>

<p>And by the time I finished practicing, the level of progress was dramatic: intervals were singing, my bow and left hand relaxed, a sense of comfort in how to navigate the notes and the phrasing.</p>

<p>It was a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to bring this</p>
