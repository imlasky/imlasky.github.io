I"œ<p>How do I get out of a slump? I exercise a few times a weak, my eating is kind of bleh, but every time I try I end up back at the same point.</p>

<p>Maybe there are different avenues to the same destination for getting out of the slump.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the 4000 week idea recently, and I feel like I just burned one or two that will never be coming back. How can I treasure the remaining weeks?</p>
