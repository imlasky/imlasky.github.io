<p>Hey there - I’m Ian. You know when you start a new project and can’t think of a name, and instead call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp</code> or something? This is my collection of those.</p>

<p>Often times these projects start with the best of intentions, but usually come when I’m working on something else I thought was exciting. The result is a bunch of projects called something along the lines of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp-project_2022-02-22_v1</code> with no other description. I’m left wading through some half-baked code just until a new idea pops into my head, causing me to create a new project - this time I intentionally called it Temp Project and it’s the site you’re on now.</p>
