<p>The idea came from me looking for a job myself. I became disenchanted by all the VC-backed companies after reading about how quite a lot of them seem to focus on something other than profitability. Instead, what if there was a way to find private companies, that are profitable and looking to grow. None of that magical, profitability-will-come-later business.</p>

<p>I tried myself to find these companies - I started on Indie Hackers, actually. I went to the Product Page and started just drilling down on each of the products. But it was a slog. Going through each one was just a tremendous effort, and frequently they are not hiring, which makes sense, since they donâ€™t <em>need</em> to unless it really hurts.</p>

<p>So, my hypothesis is this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A lot of those in the tech community are looking for a more pure experience to business. Something that doesnâ€™t involve chasing new valuations, and overtaking the world.</li>
  <li>Independent companies hire when it hurts. Theyâ€™ve figured out how to become profitable and certainly want to keep it that way.</li>
  <li>Connecting these two groups together will help give access to more talent to the independent companies and fulfill what the job seekers are looking for.</li>
</ol>

<p>From some other projects, Iâ€™ve picked up <a href="kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>. It just got to 1.0, so (hopefully) no more breaking changes. Itâ€™s fast and easy to use to spin up a frontend along with <a href="tailwindcss.com">TailwindCSS</a>.</p>

<p>For the backend, Iâ€™ll have a q</p>
