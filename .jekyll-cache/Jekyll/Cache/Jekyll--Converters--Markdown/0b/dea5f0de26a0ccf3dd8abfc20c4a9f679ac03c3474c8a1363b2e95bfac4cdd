I"<p>Today, I made some delicious lentil soup. I added a bit of heavy cream into it and watched the vortices within the soup as I moved my ladle through it. It made me think back to the show<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8134186/">Devs</a> and what it would take to simulate such entropy. There must be millions of people making soup a day, all with their own little vortices. How many FLOPS would it take to reverse everyoneâ€™s soup that day? I feel like we are not even close to the computing power to simulate that.</p>
