I"_<p>Yesterday I added some analytics to this blog, since I was already adding some to my project,<a href="/projects/2023/01/02/indie-comp-jobs.html">Indie Comp Jobs</a>.</p>

<p>But then I realized something: I really don’t care about analytics for my blog. I mean, what do I really get out of it? Seeing how many people are reading? Seeing what they like? I’m not writing for them - I’m writing for me.</p>

<p>I’ll add an email in case there is someone out there that actually does ready these posts and wants to chat, but other than that, I swiftly deleted the analytics because fuck metrics.</p>
