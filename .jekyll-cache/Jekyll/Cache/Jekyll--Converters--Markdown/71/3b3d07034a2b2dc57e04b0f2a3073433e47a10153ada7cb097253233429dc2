<p>Okay, I mostly just wanted to share some of my favorite violinists, but I also wanted to talk about <em>why</em> I like them so much and how that reason also propagates into why I like certain products just the same.</p>

<p>If you look closely, each of these violinists have a certain whimsical nature to their playing. This isnâ€™t to say their playing is funny, but itâ€™s playful (even for such an intense piece as Ysaye 3), it has an interest to it thatâ€™s plastered all over their face in their playing and then rebounds into their sound - itâ€™s electric to watch. If you have a few spare moments, I really encourage you to take some time to watch the performances above.</p>

<p>Whether it was this whimsical nature that has made them stand out originally, or it came out <em>because</em> theyâ€™re so good, I donâ€™t know. But I am willing to bet that it is more of the former than the latter.</p>

<p>This same idea translates directly to some products I enjoy using just because the creator took the time to add in some whimsy to it. One I quite like, and use regularly, is Pocketbase. Letâ€™s look:</p>

<p>Letâ€™s take a look at a third - Posthog. I mean, just look at their homepage, whimsy is all over the place and Iâ€™m here for it.</p>
