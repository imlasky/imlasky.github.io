I"$<p>I love cooking and, if food is always available in my fridge, I generally cook healthy, filling meals.</p>

<p>However, getting groceries has alwyas been an issue for me. Going to the grocery store is a 99% of the time a non-starter. I don’t want to go get a week’s worth of groceries and schlep them home.</p>

<p>Online grocery shopping is easier; however, the time it takes to decide what I want to get, search for it, add it to the cart, and <em>then</em> order is enough of a sticking point for me to give up entirely and walk across the street and to get some pad thai.</p>

<p>So, I figured I’d make something that makes this issue a little easier for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>What would help me best would be able to look at a recipe, take all the ingredients, and have them added to my cart from my grocery store of choice.</p>

<p>Once that is working, I’d like to extend it to allow me to take pictures of recipes from books, extract the ingredients, and do the same thing.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-want-it-to-work">How I want it to work</h2>

<p>In my mind, there are 3 primary stages to the process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I enter the site of the recipe</li>
  <li>Ingredients are extracted from the recipe</li>
  <li>Those ingredients are added to the grocery app’s cart</li>
</ol>
