I"½<blockquote>
  <p>When thereâ€™s wrinkles in your sleeves</p>

  <p>You take off your shirt and you steam it</p>

  <p>When thereâ€™s dishes piled high in the sink</p>

  <p>You get out the sponge and start cleaninâ€™</p>

  <p>Oh, these menial tasks distract from the fact</p>

  <p>Thereâ€™s a whole in your soul like a wall has a crack</p>

  <p>You put off the repairs, pretend theyâ€™re not there</p>

  <p>And you fail to address the mess â€˜cause youâ€™re scared</p>

  <p>So you look for a source to carry the weight</p>

  <p>To lighten the load of a soul gone astray</p>

  <p>To wake you up and get you through the day</p>

  <p>To cut through the brush, show you the way</p>
