<p>Okay, I mostly just wanted to share some of my favorite violinists, but I also wanted to talk about <em>why</em> I like them so much and how that reason also propagates into why I like certain products just the same.</p>

<p>If you look closely (or read the title), each of these violinists have a certain whimsical nature to their playing. This isnâ€™t to say their playing is funny, but itâ€™s playful (even for such an intense piece as Ysaye 3), it has an interest to it thatâ€™s plastered all over their face in their playing and then rebounds into their sound - itâ€™s electric to watch. Seriously, if you have a few spare moments, take some time to watch the performances above.</p>

<p>Whether it was this whimsical nature that has made them stand out originally, or it came out <em>because</em> theyâ€™re so good, I donâ€™t know. But I am willing to bet that it is more of the former than the latter.</p>
