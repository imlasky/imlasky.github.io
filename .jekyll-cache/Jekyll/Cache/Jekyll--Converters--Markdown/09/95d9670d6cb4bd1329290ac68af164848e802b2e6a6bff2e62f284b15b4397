I"‘<p><strong><em>Hangry</em></strong> (adj.): bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m dealing with a dilemma. I am trying intermittent fasting to lose weight. But on the flip side, I become extremely hangry. Currently trying to figure out how to deal with it. Maybe Iâ€™ll start drinking coffee again to curb my appetite? That seems like a step in the wrong direction though.</p>
