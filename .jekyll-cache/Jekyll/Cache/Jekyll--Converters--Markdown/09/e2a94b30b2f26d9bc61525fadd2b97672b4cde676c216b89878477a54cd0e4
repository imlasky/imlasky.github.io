I"y<p>I <em>love</em> food.</p>

<p>And with it, I love cooking.</p>

<p>I know that I can add cream, cheese, basil, tomatoes, and chicken stock to a pan and make a great sauce for salmon.</p>

<p>I know that I can put avocados, tomatoes, onion, lime, cumin, salt, and pepper together to make good guacamole.</p>

<p>I know that I can slowly brown onions, add wine and beef broth to make some tasty onion soup.</p>

<p>It’s all replicable and I can zhuzh it up however I want. Not just salt to taste, but modify to taste.</p>

<p>I’m not a painter or a sculptor; I can’t draw or do photography - but I can cook.</p>

<p>It’s a transient art.</p>

<p>One that doesn’t last forever but is to be experienced.</p>

<p>It can be reproduced, but it won’t be the same meal.</p>

<p>Artful transience. Here for a brief moment to be enjoyed, and then gone.</p>

<p>The same kind of ethereal nature as the sand mandalas created by monks.</p>

<p>The art is the doing, rather than the end result.</p>

<p>In the same way that those mandalas are swept away at the end of their creation, so too are my meals.</p>

<p>I enjoy dismantling my art.</p>
