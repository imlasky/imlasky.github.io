  <li>I want to make money, but I also want to build something I like</li>
  <li>I have to keep reminding myself that I need to build something that solves a problem for myself</li>

  <li>A search engine that is strictly for reviews</li>
  <li>A drag-and-drop platform for data analysis</li>
  <li>An idea to simplify returns (like a reverse last-mile logistics sort of thing)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think there is potential in all of them (some more than others), but yet I find I am just <em>blah</em> about all of them when I get down to it.</p>
