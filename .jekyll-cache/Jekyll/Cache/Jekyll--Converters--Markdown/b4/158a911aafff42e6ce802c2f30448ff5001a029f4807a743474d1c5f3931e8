I"w<blockquote>
  <p>When there’s wrinkles in your sleeves
You take off your shirt and you steam it
When there’s dishes piled high in the sink
You get out the sponge and start cleanin’
Oh, these menial tasks distract from the fact
There’s a whole in your soul like a wall has a crack
You put off the repairs, pretend they’re not there
And you fail to address the mess ‘cause you’re scared
So you look for a source to carry the weight
To lighten the load of a soul gone astray
To wake you up and get you through the day
To cut through the brush, show you the way</p>
