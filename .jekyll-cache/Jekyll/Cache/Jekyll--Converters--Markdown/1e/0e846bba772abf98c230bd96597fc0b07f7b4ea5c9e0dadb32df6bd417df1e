I"`<p>Today I went to Walden Pond. Itâ€™s a bit of a famous body of water here in Massachusetts as it was home to Henry David Thoreau for over two years. (2 years, 2 months, and 2 days, to be exact) He actually lived in a little cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson allowed Thoreau to set up his cabin there and conduct his experiment.</p>
