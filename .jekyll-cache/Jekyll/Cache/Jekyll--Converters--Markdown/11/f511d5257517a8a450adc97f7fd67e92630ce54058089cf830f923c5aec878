I"T<p>Violin has been a part of my life for a little over 3 years now.</p>

<p>I’ve gone through 4 of the Suzuki books and I’m currently working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkmxC8UXPMM">J.S. Bach: Sonata for Violin Solo No. 3 in C Major, BWV 1005 - III. Largo</a>.</p>

<p>The piece is classic Bach – clear, beautiful, melodic lines, with intervals that are unforgiving.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this is a tough piece for me.</p>

<p>Making progress has been rough up until my last lesson.</p>

<p>She imparted some wisdom that extends beyond just violin and something I’ve been thinking about since.</p>

<p>In it’s simplest form, she said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focus on the detail to enjoy the beauty during the process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to hear the gorgeous lines that Bach has crafted in its entirety, and so I was practicing like that.</p>

<p>But to properly learn to play it, I need to work from the details up.</p>

<p>“How should this interval sound?”</p>

<p>“How does my finger feel when I play this double stop?”</p>

<p>“Can I move my wrist to make this transition more comfortable?”</p>

<p>“What if I put my second finger down first?”</p>

<p>I should take enjoyment in the minutiae of crafting the piece from the ground up, almost walking in Bach’s footsteps as he wrote the piece.</p>
