I"Ù<p>Hi there, {applicant}!</p>

<p>Weâ€™re so happy that you expressed your interest in joining <strong>tech.ai</strong> â€” the leading tech AI company transforming the {industry} industry that is <em>definitely not</em> just an API call to OpenAI!</p>

<p>We have received your application and are happy to move you on to the first round! ðŸ¥³ The first round is a take-home assignment which shouldnâ€™t take you more than 2-3 weeks. We hope you have as much fun completing it as we have had designing it! Itâ€™s designed to test a variety of skills such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>perseverance</li>
  <li>obedience</li>
  <li>how much shit you can take</li>
  <li>your desperation for a job</li>
  <li>coding!</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ve attached the prompt for the first round to this email, itâ€™s a quick 22 page read to give you sufficient background into the problem. (Hint: donâ€™t forget the quirk on page 17!).</p>

<p>The expected output is a design document that is expected to contain UML diagrams, Figma wireframes, burndown charts of your progress, a picture of a pony, and a detailed document of your approach and reasoning for each line of code. Additionally, we expect the project to be completed in both python 2.7 and 3.11 - we advise creating a docker image of your project so we can run it on our end.</p>

<p>Due to the high volume of applicants, we canâ€™t guarantee that weâ€™ll get back to you with detailed feedback, but weâ€™ll make sure to maybe skim some of the first page.</p>
