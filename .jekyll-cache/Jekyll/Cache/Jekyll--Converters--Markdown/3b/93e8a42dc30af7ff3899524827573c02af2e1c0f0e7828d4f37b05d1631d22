I"‰<p>Iâ€™ve been reading more and more lately. More of other peopleâ€™s words. More of other peopleâ€™s thoughts, ideas, concepts, opinions, and tangents. And I have started to wonder how their voice comes through so clearly - how they seem to just make words connect to each other, and I believe it just comes down to the fact that they have been doing it more, and for longer than I have.</p>
