I"4<p>Okay, so the date is a <em>bit</em> of a lie on this post. It is technically the morning of January 8th - but what even is time, really? Go a couple light-hours away (maybe to Neptune or Pluto) and it’ll still be January 7th in the observer’s eyes. As they say “it’s January 7th somewhere”.</p>
