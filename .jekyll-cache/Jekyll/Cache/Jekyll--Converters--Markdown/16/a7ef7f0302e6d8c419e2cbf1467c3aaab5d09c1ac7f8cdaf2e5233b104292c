I"–<p>If you havenâ€™t seen it, thereâ€™s this great site called<a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>. Their visualizations and data-based story telling is truly unique.</p>

<p>I looked at their videos that showed how they went about their creative process - it seems a lot of it is in Svelte, with D3.js. I became interested in whether or not there existed a blogging platform out there that would allow quicker publishing of such stories.</p>

<p>It turns out, there are not that much out there.</p>

<p>I think I would like to start blogging with more data-centric ideas, maybe as a way to find interesting themes, work on my technical writing, and use my data analysis strengths.</p>

<p>Plus good data visualizations are <em>chefâ€™s kiss</em>.</p>

<p>So, I think I will start to make a platform that fits my needs first. A way to upload data relevant to certain text, maybe some nice animations tied to scrolling, etc. Something that would truly allow such journalism to flourish a bit. Iâ€™m thinking something along the lines of Ghost, but for data visualization writing.</p>

<p>No idea how to get started, but I will look a bit more into it tomorrow.</p>
