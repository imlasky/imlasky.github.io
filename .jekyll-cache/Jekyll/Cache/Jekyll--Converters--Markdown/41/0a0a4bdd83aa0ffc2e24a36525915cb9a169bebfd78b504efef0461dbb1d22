I"Å<p>Today I went to a hotpot place in Chinatown. Nevermind the blaring drums I heard, I was in the mood for some hotpot and went.</p>

<p>When I went there, the lunar new year festival was ongoing, with its brilliant red and yellow dragons, crackling fireworks, and crowds of onlookers.</p>

<p>I made my way inside the restaurant, only to be followed moments after by what was outside - the drums and dragons.</p>

<p>They danced around the restaurant, tossing lettuce out of their mouths, and quite frankly was one of the more unique experiences I have had in a while.</p>

<p>The hotpot was good too.</p>

<p>I got the tonkotsu broth.</p>
