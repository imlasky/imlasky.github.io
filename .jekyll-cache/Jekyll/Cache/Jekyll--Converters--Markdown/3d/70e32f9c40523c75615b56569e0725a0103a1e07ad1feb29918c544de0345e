I"ü<p>â€œRight tool for the right jobâ€</p>

<p>Somehow Iâ€™ve never fully internalized that quote. I think it has to do with needing to know what the right tool is in the first place. If you never hammered a nail into wood, how would you know to use a hammer except through experience?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The right tools, not necessarily the best tools, make it easier to get started</li>
  <li>Starting from scratch is usually worse</li>
  <li>Accepting the ebb and flow of interest is fucking tough</li>
</ul>
