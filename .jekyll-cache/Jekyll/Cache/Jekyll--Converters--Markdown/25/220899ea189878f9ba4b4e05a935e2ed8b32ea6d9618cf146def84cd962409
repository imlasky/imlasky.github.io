I"è<p>I‚Äôve struggled with my weight a bunch over the years - with it going up and going down. And it has resulted in an unhealthy relationship with the scale.</p>

<p>I look at the number and I become happy or sad.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not a good way to live.</p>

<p>So, today, the first day back at the gym in a <em>while</em>, I decided I want to measure my progress in other ways. These can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How I feel that day</li>
  <li>How my shirts feel on my body</li>
  <li>How frequently I am out of breath</li>
  <li>My hunger levels throughout the day</li>
  <li>Whether I begin to seek more physically-engaging activities</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in keeping with my simplicity them, I want to really start to listen to my body, feel how it reacts each day, and take better care of it, rather than reducing all of my joy, or ability to experience joy, down to a single number I see in the morning.</p>
