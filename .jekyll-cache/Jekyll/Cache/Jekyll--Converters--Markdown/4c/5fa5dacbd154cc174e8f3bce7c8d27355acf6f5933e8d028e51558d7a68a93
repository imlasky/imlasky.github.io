<p>I read a post a little while ago on Bearblog called <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/mvp-vs-slc/">â€œWhy products should be â€˜slickâ€™, not just viableâ€</a>, and it really resonated with me.</p>

<p>Instead of using MVP (minimum viable product) as the measure of an incremental unit of a product, he uses SLC (simple, lovable, and complete). In essence, SLC is the idea that the product should be complete from the onset â€“ that even though there <em>could</em> be more added to the product, it doesnâ€™t necessarily need to in order to operate as its main function.</p>

<p>However, the key difference between SLC and MVP, in my eyes, is the L â€“ lovable. Take, for instance, ChatGPT. Itâ€™s a cha box. Thatâ€™s it. Chat has been around forever. The design is not new.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s lovable. It was (until Threads, maybe) the fastest growing service ever because it was just that good.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-the-only-user">I am the only user</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s another idea that also resonated - <a href="https://blubsblog.bearblog.dev/i-am-the-only-user/">being the only user.</a>From this one, I gained the insight that my products that I have developed previously were for some ephemeral â€œuserâ€ that I thought I identified with. However, when developing the product, I quickly became aware that I wouldnâ€™t use this it ever, let alone <em>pay</em> for it.</p>

<p>So, I started to truly look for problems in my own life, ones that I actually become angry at because â€œwhy is it like this? How has there been <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> to solve this yet?â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve found 2 problems and will write up some project posts about it soon.</p>

<p>But because they were truly my problems, I was able to quickly solve them. Sure, theyâ€™re the software equivalent of duct tape and WD-40, but they work!</p>
