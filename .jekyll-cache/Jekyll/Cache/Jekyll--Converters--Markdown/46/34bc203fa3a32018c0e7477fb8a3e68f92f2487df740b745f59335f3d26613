I"å<p>Iâ€™m traveling soon. World travels. Maybe for a year or two. And, as one does, Iâ€™m going to make a blog.</p>

<p>While Jekyll has been good to me for this blog, what I want is something that is more flexible, and something I donâ€™t have to write in markdown in VSCode and push changes.</p>

<p>No, I want dead-easy, drag-and-drop, flexible, mobile-friendly, and <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>I want to be able to move images where I want them, add sounds of city streets as someone reads a post, be able to draw arrows right on the page to point to something interesting.</p>

<p>I want to be able to keep my family and friends up to date when a new post is there and know where I am in the world, give them the ability to add suggestions â€“ make posts <em>multiplayer</em>.</p>

<p>There are a few platforms out there that embody similar ideals, and Iâ€™m trying to create a mashup of them.</p>

<p>My inspiration is coming from sites like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mmm.page">mmm.page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear Blog</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, letâ€™s get cracking!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve already laid the groundwork for text and images. Namely, Iâ€™ve been able to integrate the TipTap editor into a new element, and select images.</p>

<p>Things like copy/paste, delete, resize, and drag to position are also in.</p>

<p>The main challenge right now is getting the elements to look right on both desktop and mobile. The idea is be able to specify where Iâ€™d want the element to be on the desktop and where I want it on mobile, if at all. Something like visual breakpoints for each element. By default, it would be a fixed element that, as the screen size shrinks, it goes off the page if outside the bounds.</p>
