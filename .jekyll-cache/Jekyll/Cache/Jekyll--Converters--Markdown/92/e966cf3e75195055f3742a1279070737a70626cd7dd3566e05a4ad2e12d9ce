I"©<p>Today I had the thought that maybe freelancing might be an interesting path forward. I can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take only the work I want</li>
  <li>Set my own rate</li>
  <li>Set my own hours</li>
  <li>Work from anywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, to do these things, I need to develop a portfolio. Iâ€™m thinking I can do something with data science, maybe some web dev, or some due diligence.</p>

<p>But I feel like it is getting closer to the ideal.</p>

<p>The only hang up is actually how much I can make with this. Maybe starting out it is a bit low, but will it increase?</p>

<p>I still want to build something of my own, so maybe this is the path towards doing that.</p>
