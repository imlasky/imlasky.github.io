  <p>When there’s wrinkles in your sleeves</p>

  <p>You take off your shirt and you steam it</p>

  <p>When there’s dishes piled high in the sink</p>

  <p>You get out the sponge and you start cleanin’</p>

  <p>Oh, these menial tasks distract from the fact</p>

  <p>There’s a whole in your soul like a wall has a crack</p>

  <p>You put off the repairs, pretend they’re not there</p>

  <p>And you fail to address the mess ‘cause you’re scared</p>

  <p>So you look for a source to carry the weight</p>

  <p>To lighten the load of a soul gone astray</p>

  <p>To wake you up and get you through the day</p>

  <p>To cut through the brush, show you the way</p>

  <p>You’ve got to find you a new, find you another</p>

  <p>Find you a new guru</p>
