I"Ø	<p>Violin has been a part of my life for a little over 3 years now.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve gone through 4 of the Suzuki books and Iâ€™m currently working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkmxC8UXPMM">J.S. Bach: Sonata for Violin Solo No. 3 in C Major, BWV 1005 - III. Largo</a>.</p>

<p>The piece is classic Bach: clear, beautiful, melodic lines, with intervals that are unforgiving. Needless to say, this is a tough piece for me.</p>

<p>Making progress has been rough up until my last lesson where my teacher imparted some wisdom that extends beyond just violin and is something Iâ€™ve been thinking about all day.</p>

<p>In itâ€™s simplest form, she said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focus on the detail to enjoy the beauty during the process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to hear the gorgeous lines that Bach has crafted in its entirety, and so I was practicing like that. But to properly learn to play it, I need to work from the details up. I canâ€™t expect to play what I have listen to right out of the gate, no matter how much I want to â€” I have to dig into it and be specific with what Iâ€™m doing.</p>

<p>â€œHow should this interval sound?â€</p>

<p>â€œHow does my finger feel when I play this double stop?â€</p>

<p>â€œCan I move my wrist to make this transition more comfortable?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat if I put my second finger down first?â€</p>

<p>â€œHow much hair should my bow have here?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhere do I want to be in the bow?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhy do I hear a rogue note?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhy isnâ€™t this note resonating right now?â€</p>

<p>I should take enjoyment in the minutiae of crafting the piece from the ground up, almost as if Iâ€™m walking in Bachâ€™s footsteps as he wrote the piece. Feel how the notes fit together â€“ how the phrase is built and rises from simple notes.</p>

<p>Today was the first day I really put this new perspective into my practice â€“ I was fired up. And by the time I finished practicing, the level of progress was dramatic: intervals were singing, my bow and left hand relaxed, a sense of comfort in how to navigate the notes and the phrasing.</p>

<p>It was a breakthrough.</p>

<p>The task now is how to translate this learning into other aspects of my life like eating better, building products, and writing. I suppose the first step is to first identify what what small units I can break things down into: meals, lines of code, and words, and work up from there and enjoy the details while not forgetting about the bigger picture as the goal.</p>
