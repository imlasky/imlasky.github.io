I"∏<p>I recently had a discussion about work and life. One of us was arguing that work and life is a balance. The other thought that it was not a zero-sum game, but rather the goal is for both to be fulfilling.</p>

<p>And it got me thinking, is there a way to combine these two schools of thought? Can work and life both be a balance <em>and</em> be a non-zero-sum game?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine that I‚Äôm able to work exactly 8 hours per day, live life 8 hours per day, and sleep 8 hours per day. Just based on time alone, this appears ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù. It is, by the traditional definition a ‚Äúgood work/life‚Äù balance.</p>

<p>In equation form, the day looks like this:</p>

<center>x_work + x_life + x_sleep = 24</center>
<p>where x_work = x_life = x_sleep = 8.</p>

<p>But it is rarely a reflection of how the day <strong><em>feels</em></strong>. What if we change the equation a bit, get a bit relativistic, and add in some ‚Äútime dilation‚Äù constants. These constants will provide a better representation of how the day feels, even if the raw hours themselves might be equal.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs check out the new equation:</p>
<center>c_work * x_work + c_life * x_life + c_sleep * x_sleep = 24</center>
