I"§<p>This morning I decided I wanted to build a little game. We‚Äôve been playing all the NYT games lately, and wanted a new challenge. I thought of an idea and part of it requires generating random words (or ruin it for myself everyday and I generate them).</p>

<p>I thought it‚Äôd be quite simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate random list of chars</li>
  <li>Check how many combinations are actually English words</li>
  <li>Check if they are relatively popular</li>
  <li>Bada bing, bada boom, I have a randomly generated list of words</li>
</ol>

<p>Except it didn‚Äôt really work that way, as most things do.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a list of <em>valid</em> English words generated by the characters ‚Äúgatroolds‚Äù:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[
  'gaol',  'tool', 'trod',
  'good',  'rood', 'gold',
  'told',  'gats', 'goos',
  'roos',  'gals', 'tools',
  'ards',  'gods', 'rods',
  'goods', 'olds', 'golds'
]</code></p>

<p>Okay, so most of the list is good (see what I did there?) - but there are some‚Ä¶strange ones that who in their right mind would ever guess? Like ards? Or gaol?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs random words, and there‚Äôs <em>random</em> words. The kind of random that I am looking for is random, but recognizable, I suppose. Should be able to give you a bit of a challenge, but nothing that is so far outside your vocab that you just will never win. Never winning is no fun.</p>

<p>So, what am I to do?</p>
