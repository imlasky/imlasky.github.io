I"L<p>I’ve been reading a book lately called Platonic (shout out to the Boston Public Library’s discover section).</p>

<p>There is this part in it that I found rather insightful: the “liking gap”.</p>

<p>The “liking gap” is the concept that how much we perceive someone likes us is usually an underestimate of how much they actually do.</p>

<p>This can be translated into a number of scenarios.</p>

<p>For me, I’ve used this when chatting to people at events – I assume they’d like to chat and are open to connection.</p>

<p>I approach them, say hello and introduce myself.</p>

<p>Most recently I was at a Bahamas concert and start chatting with a couple people next to me.</p>

<p>They weren’t initiating, but once I did, we connected over our love of the band and chatted about their new album – it was a great connection!</p>

<p>The best part of all this is that it is <em>repeatable</em> and <em>practicable</em>. I can do it whenever, wherever, make new connections, meet new people, learn about them and their world and maybe, just maybe, foster a new friendship.</p>
