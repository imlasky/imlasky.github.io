I"œ<p>Lately, there seems to be a growing energy around bring simplicity back to the web. For instance, just today, on the top of HN, were two posts about RSS feeds and bringing them back.<a href="#0">[0]</a><a href="#1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also seen a growing number of blog posts from<a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bearblog</a>which, had I not already made this blog, Iâ€™d happily use its interface (Iâ€™m actually considering transitioning, but just havenâ€™t pulled the trigger just yet). Itâ€™s â€œbearâ€ bones. Just text. No fluff. It isnâ€™t trying to use data. <strong><em>It respects you as a user</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I found this is the case for a growing number of companies. Theyâ€™re focusing on being the antithesis of whatâ€™s currently seen in big tech. They thrive off being the ones that donâ€™t track you, donâ€™t try to scam you, and really just represent good business. One of my favorites, and one that I use on my projects, is <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible</a>. They make analytics simple. Add a script to your site and your done. Itâ€™s private, so no need for GDPR banners or anything. Itâ€™s fantastic and it just works.</p>

<p>This trend of returning to the roots of the internet, towards the simplicity, doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s going backwards - it feels as though weâ€™ve learned lessons along the way and have become more appreciative of the pureness of the simpler aspects of the web.</p>
