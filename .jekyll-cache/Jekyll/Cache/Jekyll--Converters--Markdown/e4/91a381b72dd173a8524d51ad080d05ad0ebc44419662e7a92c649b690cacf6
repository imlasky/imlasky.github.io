I"¸<p>Quitting is a topic that has multiple feelings associated with it depending upon the situation.</p>

<p>One feelings is a sense of freedom: â€œIâ€™ve quit that thing thatâ€™s been holding me downâ€. This kind of quitting feels good to the bones like eating chicken soup when you have a cold.</p>

<p>The other kind of feeling is bittersweet and almost reluctant. This kind of quitting is never black and white; itâ€™s a kind of quitting that somehow gives both staying and quitting benefits.</p>

<p>To think about it a bit more objectively, this quitting is an opportunity cost equation: â€œAm I going to be better off if I quit this thing?â€</p>

<p>Traditionally, Iâ€™ve been on the side of cut loose and move on; thereâ€™ll be more. But lately, Iâ€™ve been thinking, maybe I should stick it out and see if thereâ€™s something over this hill Iâ€™m climbing - something that doesnâ€™t just make me feel like Iâ€™m Sisyphus with the boulder.</p>
