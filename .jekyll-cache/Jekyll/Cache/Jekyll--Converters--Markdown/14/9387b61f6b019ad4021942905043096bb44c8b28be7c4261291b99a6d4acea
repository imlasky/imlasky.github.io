I"´<p>Iâ€™ve become convinced that there will always be an elusive perfect library in the open source community. That is, for the purposes Iâ€™m trying to use something, all packages out there miss the mark <em>just</em> enough, that I need to go write it on my own. I know that sounds super privileged, and I fully support the OSS community - but just once, itâ€™d be great to find a library that just <em>works</em> for me, ya know?</p>
