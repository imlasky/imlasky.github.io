I"•<blockquote>
  <p>When thereâ€™s wrinkles in your sleeves</p>

  <p>You take off your shirt and you steam it</p>

  <p>When thereâ€™s dishes piled high in the sink</p>

  <p>You get out the sponge and start cleaninâ€™
Oh, these menial tasks distract from the fact
Thereâ€™s a whole in your soul like a wall has a crack
You put off the repairs, pretend theyâ€™re not there
And you fail to address the mess â€˜cause youâ€™re scared
So you look for a source to carry the weight
To lighten the load of a soul gone astray
To wake you up and get you through the day
To cut through the brush, show you the way</p>
