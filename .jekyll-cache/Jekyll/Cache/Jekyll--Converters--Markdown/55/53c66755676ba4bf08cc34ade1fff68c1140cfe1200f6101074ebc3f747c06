I"1<p>Barley tea has been a relatively new discovery for myself. It is exactly what it sounds like: barley boiled in hot water.</p>

<p>But I find myself basically chugging it now.</p>

<p>That slight bit of toasty, warm-by-the-fire, safe-in-my-little-cottage flavor seems to keep calling me back - and it isnâ€™t even that strong of a flavor. It just whispers to me and draws me in for another sip.</p>

<p>I want to make more things like barley tea; things that keep calling me back with their simplicity and always provide just the right amount of delight.</p>
