<p>Hey there - I’m Ian.</p>

<p>You know when you start a new project and can’t think of a name, and instead call it <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp</code></em> or something?</p>

<p>For me, these projects start with the best of intentions, but usually come when I’m working on something else I thought was exciting. So, of course, I ditch that project I made progress on, create a sparkling new directory (oh, how I love a brand new directory) and dive into this new distraction only for the cycle to repeat.</p>

<p>The result is a bunch of projects with names like <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp-project_2022-02-22_v1</code></em> with no other description (definitely no comments either). So, if I ever decide to revist such a project, I’m left wading through some half-baked code just until a new idea pops into my head, causing me to create yet another new directory.</p>

<p>However, this time something different happened - this time I intentionally called it <em><strong>Temp Project</strong></em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-doing-here">What I’m doing here</h2>

<p>Well, I’m not quite sure yet.</p>

<p>First thing is I wanted to get a site of my own - start getting my thoughts on paper (or digital) somehow. So, I think first and foremost this is a way for me to journal my thoughts.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to create a website that hosts a bunch of these temp projects, potentially motivating me to finish them, or get them to a point where “Yeah, I guess it works” is a satisfying conclusion. If any of them make money, awesome; however, I think I have come around to learn that I need to get through a volume of work before it starts getting any good.<a href="https://vimeo.com/85040589">[1]</a></p>

<p>This is my volume.</p>
