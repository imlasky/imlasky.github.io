I"ú<p>I just spent the last two nights in a<a href="https://getaway.house/">Getaway</a>. The ethos of the entire experience is to disconnect, embrace nature, yourself, and find a new balance.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be making a lengthier version tomorrow since I want to keep this short tonight.</p>

<p>But I feel like Iâ€™ve experienced something primal. Something that braced me by my shoulders, shook me, and said â€œHey, wake up. This is living.â€</p>

<p>I now want to figure out how to feel that everyday.</p>
