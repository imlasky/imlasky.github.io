  <p>When there’s wrinkles in your sleeves</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You take off your shirt and you steam it</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When there’s dishes piled high in the sink</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get out the sponge and start cleanin’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, these menial tasks distract from the fact</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a whole in your soul like a wall has a crack</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You put off the repairs, pretend they’re not there
And you fail to address the mess ‘cause you’re scared
So you look for a source to carry the weight
To lighten the load of a soul gone astray
To wake you up and get you through the day
To cut through the brush, show you the way</p>
</blockquote>
