I"1<p>Started to learn a bit of Elixir today. I was going through the book “Elixir in Action” and found myself doing the same thing I always do: think the material is easy, go too far ahead to where it looks new, and then become confused because I don’t know the syntax whatsoever.</p>

<p>I caught myself early this time, though, and decided to do it a bit differently. Instead of reading from the book, I’ll learn by directly applying and working through the struggle. So, I am going to try to complete Advent of Code 2022 all in Elixir to see how it goes. It took me nearly <strong><em>2 hours</em></strong> to solve the first puzzle - I felt like I was back in CS 101.</p>

<p>I like the language, though. I have also been interested in getting more acquainted with a functional programming language. It is elegant in its syntax. From peeking a bit ahead in the book, it also feels very powerful being built on top of Erlang and getting all the processing capability from there too.</p>

<p>The first step at being good at something is being bad at something.</p>
