### Motivation and hypothesis
The idea came from me looking for a job myself. I became disenchanted trying to find a job from a non-VC-backed company. It was (and still is) legitimately difficult to do so. So, I thought: what if there was a way to find private companies that are profitable and looking to grow? None of that magical, profitability-will-come-later business that is so frequent with VC-backed startups. 

I tried myself to find these companies - I started on Indie Hackers, actually. I went to the Product Page and started just drilling down on each of the products. But it was a slog. Going through each one was just a tremendous effort, and frequently they are not hiring, which makes sense, since they don't *need* to unless it really hurts. 

So, my hypothesis is that in this two-sided marketplace, there are these characteristics of the job seekers and the companies:
* There is a growing sentiment in the tech community to look for more meaningful work rather than just chasing the salaries. Something that doesn't involve going after new valuations, overtaking the world, and can provide a good balance.
* Independent companies hire when it hurts. They've figured out how to become profitable and certainly want to keep it that way. 

### How I plan to build it

I plan to built it using[Phoenix.](https://phoenixproject.org) It is, in part, a way to learn more about Elixir and Phoenix, but also to incorporate some little "hey, that's kinda cool" effects along the way that I know would be a pain in the ass otherwise. 

I'm taking inspiration from[Japan Dev](https://japan-dev.com) and[Remote \| OK](https://remoteok.com), borrowing a from each. Namely, I like Remoteok's idea of first finding jobs to populate and become, essentially, a link aggregator initially to build the job-seeker side of the market. But I also like Japan Dev's idea of being paid _after_ the applicant gets the job, making it lower-stakes for the companies to post. 

As for monetization, I want to eventually rely solely on companies posting their jobs, and maybe some add-on services like visibility boosts. But I'm not worried about that right now. I just want people using it. 

### Timeline

I'm giving myself a month to try to flesh out a working prototype, source the jobs, and get people on the platform using it.

## Updates

I'll be adding updates here as I continue to build. Here we go!
