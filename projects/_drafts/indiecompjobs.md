### Motivation and hypothesis
The idea came from me looking for a job myself. I became disenchanted by all the VC-backed companies after reading about how quite a lot of them seem to focus on something other than profitability. Instead, what if there was a way to find private companies, that are profitable and looking to grow. None of that magical, profitability-will-come-later business.

I tried myself to find these companies - I started on Indie Hackers, actually. I went to the Product Page and started just drilling down on each of the products. But it was a slog. Going through each one was just a tremendous effort, and frequently they are not hiring, which makes sense, since they don't *need* to unless it really hurts. 

So, my hypothesis is this:
1. A lot of those in the tech community are looking for a more pure experience to business. Something that doesn't involve chasing new valuations, and overtaking the world. 
2. Independent companies hire when it hurts. They've figured out how to become profitable and certainly want to keep it that way. 
3. Connecting these two groups together will help give access to more talent to the independent companies and fulfill what the job seekers are looking for.

### How I plan to build it

From some other projects, I've picked up [SvelteKit](kit.svelte.dev). It just got to 1.0, so (hopefully) no more breaking changes. It's fast and easy to use to spin up a frontend along with [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com). 

For the backend, I'll have a q
