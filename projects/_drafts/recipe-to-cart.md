I love cooking and, if food is always available in my fridge, I generally cook healthy, filling meals. 

However, getting groceries has alwyas been an issue for me. Going to the grocery store is a 99% of the time a non-starter. I don't want to go get a week's worth of groceries and schlep them home. 

Online grocery shopping is easier; however, the time it takes to decide what I want to get, search for it, add it to the cart, and _then_ order is enough of a sticking point for me to give up entirely and walk across the street and to get some pad thai. 

So, I figured I'd make something that makes this issue a little easier for me. 

## The Idea

What would help me best would be able to look at a recipe, take all the ingredients, and have them added to my cart from my grocery store of choice.

Once that is working, I'd like to extend it to allow me to take pictures of recipes from books, extract the ingredients, and do the same thing.

## How I want it to work

In my mind, there are 3 primary stages to the process:
1. I enter the site of the recipe
2. Ingredients are extracted from the recipe
3. Those ingredients are added to the grocery app's cart
