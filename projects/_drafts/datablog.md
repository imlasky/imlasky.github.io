I've been recently appreciating the brilliant design and deliver of[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool). And after watching a video series of how they made just _one_ of their posts, it got me thinking of a way to make this form of storytelling more accessible.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org) has been around for a bit, and I **love** the philosophy behind it: open-source and writer-centric. I want to bring the same sort of accessibility as Ghost, and substack, and medium to data journalism. 

As of right now, writers need to write their articles and develop their plots, diagrams, and visuals separately. But what if there was a way to incorporate that into the writing process itself? Being able to pinpoint certain animations you want to accentuate, certain trends you want to emphasize to the reader. 

I know I absolutely love being guided like this through an analysis like that.
